    <h1> Bass Ruminations I</h1>
  
  <p>As I&#39;ve been trying to improve at bass improvisation, I have found that I have two major challenges that get me when I try to follow a chord progression: identifying where the root notes <em>are</em> on the fretboard, and then assigning the chords to them that I want to play. The fretboard identification will get better with time, I feel, but I really should know the chord shapes better than I currently do, given how often I doodle.</p>

<p>Today, I&#39;ll go over my arpeggiation challenges.</p>

<p>At the moment, I&#39;m most comfortable when a riff or line stays on three strings and four frets: all right under my fingers. Scalar lines built on thirds are home territory, and I know most of the common chords so long as the root doesn&#39;t change: I anchor on it and can improvise in that scale. </p>

<p>Although this is (very!) fun, this tendency to anchor in one scale does not prepare me at all for &#39;playing the changes&#39;: as a bass player, I need to change the root I&#39;m referencing every chord of the song! Once I learn the chord progression, it&#39;s not quite enough to just move my existing scalar system around the fretboard: I <em>very</em> regularly find my root on the third or fourth string and since my system is three strings tall... I run out of space!</p>

<p>That means I need to learn multiple ways to play the same chords, which is hard because I only know them as a particular shape. But I found an insight that seems promising.</p>

<p>I am very comfortable with the Major Third and Minor Third intervals, and you can play them in two easy ways: &quot;up and left a bit&quot; and &quot;down the string&quot;. Further, the chords I&#39;m interested in arpeggiating can be constructed from thirds. The Major Seventh, for example, is a Major Third, and then from there a Minor Third, and then a Major Third from there. Here&#39;s a summary:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maj: major, minor</li>
<li>Min: minor, major</li>
<li>Aug: major, major</li>
<li>Dim: minor, minor</li>
<li>Maj7: major, minor, major</li>
<li>Min7: minor, major, minor</li>
<li>Dom7: major, minor, minor</li>
<li>Dim7: minor, minor, major</li>
</ul>

<p>These are pretty easy to memorize, and so as long as I get better at knowing where the root note <em>is</em>, I can know several ways to fit it onto the strings. For example, if I am on the D string on my root, and want to play a Maj7, I can either go up and over to my major third, and then I know I have to play a minor third, which (because I don&#39;t have another string) needs to be played down-the-string. I don&#39;t have to guess the fret though, because I know it&#39;s three frets down, since I know the minor third by heart. Then I know I want to get up another major third, which is gonna be a large but familiar jump up 5 frets, or &#39;a tetris L&#39; down two strings if I want to jump down the octave.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how clear that is, but it&#39;s gonna be how I&#39;m going to approach creating a &#39;roadmap&#39; of the fretboard, and it&#39;s been a fun week practicing it!</p>
