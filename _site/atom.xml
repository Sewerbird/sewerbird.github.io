   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me, looking at the issue of elevating an oblique object in a subclause to an argument of the matrix clause, that the reason why we might be making its sentence passive is precisely to elevate that object to the ‘first argument’ status. And, as we’ve said, we happily relativize the ‘first’ argument of a verb with a gap strategy. However, because the ‘first’ argument isn’t as prototypically ‘agent-like’, let’s introduce an irregularity and use the “front + di” relativization method, instead of the gap method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;kaseta Ríta nisam kajis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;dislike Rita against rain&lt;/em&gt;
Rita doesn’t like the rain
&lt;strong&gt;PLUS&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;kajis dawi di lek tímitim nar tatíri min hi Sakir&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;throw rain away stick for dog under PASS Sakir&lt;/em&gt;
The rain was thrown-away-under concerning a stick for a dog by Sakir
&lt;strong&gt;EQUALS&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;kaseta Ríta nisam kajis dawi di lek tímitim nar tatíri min hi Sakir&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
_dislike Rita against rain throw REL away stick for dog under PASS Sakir _
Rita doesn’t like the rain in which Sakir threw a stick for spot&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHAM: I like that much more. Let’s place it in other positions in the matrix clause, just to do a once-over:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;kaseta kajis dawi di lek tímitim nar tatíri min hi Sakir nisam Ríta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;dislike rain throw REL away stick for dog under PASS Sakir against Rita&lt;/em&gt;
The rain within which Sakir threw a stick for the dog disliked Rita&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sam Rita sir nanik wa kajis dawi di lek tímitim nar tatíri min hi Sakir&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;go Rita toward home upon rain throw REL away stick for dog under PASS Sakir&lt;/em&gt;
Rita went home at the same time as the rain within which Sakir threw a stick for the dog&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I’m feeling it. A lot of work here, though, for an utterance that no one hoping to be well-understood would speak out loud, but languages have to be rich enough to accomodate ineffective people effectively. Naturally, the form of the passive will be different if we leave out the actor. Here are out examples leaving out ‘Sakir’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;kaseta Ríta nisam kajis min dawi di lek tímitim nar tatíri&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
_dislike Rita against rain under(PASS) throw REL away stick for dog _
Rita doesn’t like the rain in which the dog was thrown a stick&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;kaseta kajis min dawi di lek tímitim nar tatíri nisam Ríta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;dislike rain under(PASS) throw REL away stick for dog against Rita&lt;/em&gt;
The rain within which a dog was thrown a stick disliked Rita&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sam Rita sir nanik wa kajis min dawi di lek tímitim nar tatíri&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;go Rita toward home upon rain under(PASS) throw REL away stick for dog&lt;/em&gt;
Rita went home at the same time as the rain within which a dog was thrown a stick&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shorter post today, since I need to work on some thoughts for the CCC project: I’ll be using Kjáhida for my cultural submission’s language, so peek over there to see mine &amp;amp; other’s efforts. Once I have something posted, remember to vote for me! :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I don’t know about you, but I’m getting really fatigued typing out all these long glosses. I anticipate we’ll take a break from clause-level syntax and visit something more basic, like noun phrases or serial verb constructions. Might skip a day tomorrow (IRL work &amp;amp; research to do). As always, thanks for tuning in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constructions this Post&lt;/strong&gt;
To relativize an oblique argument of the subclause, use the passive to make it the ‘first’ argument, then use the “front + di” method of relativization to promote it to an argument of the matrix verb clause.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Oblique Relativization I</title>

   <updated>2014-02-19T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/kyahida/2014/02/19/The Meek Shall Inherit</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In what, in my eyes, is the culmination of several days of build-up, we shall attain the lofty goal of elevating an oblique object of a subclause to the grand status of subject of a matrix verb! I must have better things to do with my life, but such is the ailment of the conlanger, I suppose. So, what precisely are we trying to achieve in terms of a typical utterance? This:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rita disliked the rain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;PLUS&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sakir threw a stick to the dog in the rain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;EQUALS&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rita disliked the rain in which Sakir threw the ball to the dog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, for reasons of making life difficult for ourselves, we have disallowed ourselves to use Kjáhida’s relativization strategy to express this sentence: instead, we will be resorting to passive and complement constructions. I made this decision &lt;em&gt;days&lt;/em&gt; ago: the choice simply required the existence of some constructs I hadn’t formulated yet. So, let’s see if that decision pans out by making ‘the rain’ become the main argument of a passive clause, and then place that passive clause into the “Rita sentence” via a complementizing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;kaseta Ríta nísam kajis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;dislike Rita against rain&lt;/em&gt;
Rita disliked the rain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLUS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;dawi kajis lek tímitim nar tatíri min hi Sakir&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;threw rain against stick under PASS Sakir&lt;/em&gt;
The rain was thrown-within by Sakir of a stick for a dog&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EQUALS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;kaseta Ríta nisam dawi kajis lek tímitim nar tatíri min hi Sakir&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;dislike Rita against throw stick away stick for dog under PASS Sakir&lt;/em&gt;
Rita disliked (that the rain was thrown-within by Sakir of a stick for a dog)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate it. Primarily because it doesn’t attain the semantic meaning I wanted to achieve: Rita is disliking the whole scenario, not just the rain: maybe she’s morally outraged at Sakir playing in the rain, and not at the rain inhibiting the dog’s play. Blecch: I could just &lt;em&gt;say&lt;/em&gt; it means that, but it’s inconsistent and really just a giant lie. Because it’s been a busy day for me, I’m feeling too tired to really fix it: I’m tempted to just be happy with the passive &amp;amp; complement constructions we’ve made up, undo our Accessibility Heirarchy decision, and let relative clauses sort this out. If I did that, we’d have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;kaseta Ríta nísam kajis dawi Sakir lek tímitim nar tatíri min di&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;dislike Rita against rain throw Sakir away stick for Dog under REL&lt;/em&gt;
Rita disliked the rain in which Sakir threw the ball to the dog&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do marginally prefer this latter sentence’s shape, but man if it doesn’t feel like giving up at the first sign of adversity. What I think I’ll do is read up on some stuff tomorrow about the nuts &amp;amp; bolts of how languages that can’t relativize all the way down the accessibility heirarchy do it. Comments &amp;amp; feedback would be great here: I’ll likely not have a ‘normal’ post tomorrow, doing reading instead of writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your help in advance if given, and for your perusal already given!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Complement Clauses</title>
   <link href="http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/kyahida/2014/02/18/Complementary%20Snacks"/>
   <updated>2014-02-18T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/kyahida/2014/02/18/Complementary Snacks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Still on the quest to use passive verbs to ‘relativize’ oblique and indirect objects of subclauses, today we will investigate complementizing a clause. ‘Complementizing’ is the process of turning an independent clause into an argument of another clause: this is distinct from relativizing in that we aren’t providing extra information about one of the verb’s actors, but instead treating the clause &lt;em&gt;as a whole&lt;/em&gt; as an argument of the verb. Some examples include “I knew &lt;strong&gt;that it was going to rain&lt;/strong&gt;”, “&lt;strong&gt;That he was stinking, filthy rich&lt;/strong&gt; came as a surprise to me”, “&lt;strong&gt;When he ran to the police&lt;/strong&gt; I grabbed the gat”, and similar. The ‘that’ in the examples is acting as a complementizer particle, although I’m not certain about the status of the last example’s “when”: it is either a complementizer or simply a preposition/adverb-thing with an ‘empty complementizer’ phrase as its argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to point out real quick that I am not addressing ‘interrogative content clauses’, which are sentences of the form “I know &lt;strong&gt;how you got all that money&lt;/strong&gt;”, “She asked &lt;strong&gt;where Jerome had stashed the bag&lt;/strong&gt;”, and such. I want to get back to those later with a different mechanism, although today’s mechanism applies just fine to ‘declarative content clauses’ like the “I knew &lt;strong&gt;Sam was a good man&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really, I think this is going to boil down to whether we’re going to have an explicit complementizer (like English ‘that’) heading up things, or not. So let’s just look at how Kjáhida would look either way, using a tentative particle ‘na’ for the explicit case:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example 1:
a)
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;lir Sakir ja [dawi Rita lek tímitim]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;saw Sakir of throw Rita away stick&lt;/em&gt;
Sakir saw Rita throw the stick&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b)
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;lir Sakir ja [na dawi Rita lek tímitim]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;saw Sakir of COMPL throw Rita away stick&lt;/em&gt;
Sakir saw Rita throw the stick&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example 2:
a)
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;tamal [rak Rita líswa tatíra] nísam Sakir&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;surprise possess Rita with dog against Sakir&lt;/em&gt;
That Rita had a dog surprised Sakir&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b)
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;tamal [na rak Rita líswa tatíra] nísam Sakir&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;surprise COMPL possess Rita with dog against Sakir&lt;/em&gt;
That Rita had a dog surprised Sakir&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A secondary option for the explicit case presents itself to us if we allow the complement to front, leaving ‘na’ in its place:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example 1:
c)
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;[dawi Rita lek tímitim] lir Sakir ja na&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;throw Rita away stick saw Sakir of that&lt;/em&gt;
Sakir saw Rita throw the stick&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example 2:
c)
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;[rak Rita líswa tatíra] tamal na nísam Sakir&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;possess rita with dog surprise that against Sakir&lt;/em&gt;
That Rita had a dog surprised Sakir&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;…An Hour of Confused Syntactaesthetic Pondering Later…&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a bit of thought, I think I’ll do for complement clauses what we did for relative clauses: we’ll use a pair of constructions based on the ‘first argument’ status of the subordinate clause. In this case, we will use the “front &amp;amp; use ‘na’” when the complement is the ‘first’, and use the unmarked construction otherwise. Precisely, we like Example 1a and 2c. Although I think that’ll be fine, this is likely the most ‘iffy’ on a decision I’ve felt so far: let me know if you think up a more ‘Kjáhidan’ approach to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daily postings are quite a task to achieve, but this one marks the first full week of such updates. Tomorrow will likely be about using our new Complement and Passive constructions together so that we can finish off our ‘relativization’ strategies for clause arguments. Once we do that, depending on my mood, we’ll really try to break our subordinate clause system with some contorted utterances and see if anything needs changing, or we’ll take a break and look at something unrelated. As always, thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constructions this Post&lt;/strong&gt;
Subject Complement Clause: &lt;complement clause=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;matrix verb=&quot;&quot;&gt; &#39;na&#39; &amp;lt;other arguments &amp;amp; phrases&amp;gt;
Non-Subject Complement Clause: &lt;matrix verb=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;subject argument=&quot;&quot;&gt; ... &amp;lt;Complement clause, unmarked&amp;gt; ...&lt;/subject&gt;&lt;/matrix&gt;&lt;/matrix&gt;&lt;/complement&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Basic Passives</title>
   <link href="http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/kyahida/2014/02/17/Passive%20Aggression"/>
   <updated>2014-02-17T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/kyahida/2014/02/17/Passive Aggression</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Entailed by last post’s determination that we’d be using passives in lieu of relativization strategies for ‘arguments’ of the verb of tertiary centrality, we need to actually create such passives… they don’t exist yet. This will be just about the first time where we modify the semantics of a particular verb: up to this point they’ve comfortably had all their ‘slots’ filled in whenever they can lob the prepositional particles towards relevant NPs. Let’s investigate ways we can change a transitive verb into a passive verb first, and then consider how to passivize intransitive and other kinds of verbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;dawi Sakir lek tímitim&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;throw Sakir from stick&lt;/em&gt;
Sakir threw away the stick&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some approaches I brainstormed which I think are near the ‘spirit’ of Kjáhida:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gap Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;
Here, we kick the agent to a PP and move the ‘object’ into the first spot, leaving the phrasal preposition where it was to mark the change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;dawi tímitim lek ø (ja/kin/wi? Sakir)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;throw stick from (of/after/concerning Sakir)&lt;/em&gt;
The stick was thrown (by Sakir)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passivizing particle ‘hi’&lt;/strong&gt;
Here, we move the ‘object’ into the first part, put the particle ‘hi’ where the object moved from, and ‘hi’ is itself a killer-P that provides an optional home for the de-emphasized agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;dawi tímitim lek hi (Sakir)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;throw stick from PASS (Sakir)&lt;/em&gt;
The stick was thrown (by Sakir)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Front Now-Empty Preposition&lt;/strong&gt;
Here, we move the ‘object’ into the first part, and lob the preposition that housed it right in front of the verb. The de-emphasized agent can assume a naked post directly after the promoted ‘object’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;lek dawi tímitim (Sakir)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;from throw stick (Sakir)&lt;/em&gt;
The stick was thrown (by Sakir)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these can be pretty interesting, and I’m tempted to choose more than one. However, they each have stylistic/artistic weaknesses to my nose. The Gap Strategy as I have here puts a bit of onus in determining what kind of PP the agent gets kicked to, and I’m not very impressed by that consequence. The Passivizing Particle approach is pretty darn attractive, introducing a new versatile Killer-P and being relatively low on the ambiguity scale; however, it reminds me pretty strongly of our second relativization strategy, and I’m not sure that’s a selling point when we want a quirky grammar. Finally, the Fronting Preposition is very simple and elegant, but it has the wholly unattractive trait of introducing Kjáhida to an ‘unheaded’ NP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’m gonna make a quick, reversible judgement call: for verbs where we want to express the de-emphasized agent, we will use the Passivizing particle. For verbs where we do not wish to have the de-emphasized agent stated whatsoever, we will use the Fronting strategy. If either one winds up tying our shoelaces, we’ll kick it away in favor for the one not messing us up as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s play around a bit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;lir Ríta ja hi Sakir&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;see Rita of PASS Sakir&lt;/em&gt;
Rita was seen by Sakir&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ja lir Rita&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;of see Rita&lt;/em&gt;
Rita was seen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;dawi tímitim lek hi Sakir nar Táti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;throw stick from PASS Sakir for Spot&lt;/em&gt;
The stick was thrown to Spot by Sakir&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;lek dawi tímitim nar Táti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;away throw stick for Spot&lt;/em&gt;
The stick was thrown to Spot&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;nísam kajis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;upon precipitate&lt;/em&gt;
It rained&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;kajis nisam hi najis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;precipitate upon PASS clouds&lt;/em&gt;
It rained due to clouds&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;kajis nisam najis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;precipatate upon the clouds&lt;/em&gt;
The clouds rained down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “intransitive” verb was probably the most difficult one there, but even that I think turned out just fine given how briefly we slapped together the construction. Now that we have passive constructions, I can think about how precisely we’ll use them for the other purpose we had in mind for them: specifying genitive, oblique, and comparatand verb arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long workday today, though, so will have to address that next post. I think these are pretty respectable passives, but let me know your thoughts/alternative approaches. Thanks for reading/skimming all the glosses I had to come up with, and for your attention generally. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constructions This Post&lt;/strong&gt;
Passive with Agent Still Stated: &lt;verb&gt; &lt;promoted np=&quot;&quot;&gt; (other args) &lt;promoted-beyond particle=&quot;&quot;&gt; &#39;hi&#39; &lt;agent&gt; (other PPs)

   <title>Basic Relative Clauses</title>
   <link href="http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/kyahida/2014/02/16/Relative%20Comfort"/>
   <updated>2014-02-16T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/kyahida/2014/02/16/Relative Comfort</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I really hadn’t meant to get into it so soon, but I suppose it is unavoidable: subordinate/dependent clauses. They are easily my favorite thing in syntax to tweak with: there are strategies based off of gaps, relativizing particles &amp;amp; pronouns, passivization schemes, and all of the previous multiplied together. Further, all this leaves aside the fun that appositive and adverbial clauses present! Today I will try to come up with a somewhat rich scheme for prototypical dependent clauses: clauses that serve the role of limiting the scope of possible referents for a verb’s argument, such as “I hate the car &lt;em&gt;that I  bought&lt;/em&gt;” or “I saw the man &lt;em&gt;who flew over my head&lt;/em&gt;” or similar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The linguistic [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_clause#Accessibility_hierarchy]”Accessibility Hierarchy”[/url] is where I’ll start off:
[quote=”Wikipedia”]
…[T]here are major restrictions on the role the antecedent may have in the relative clause.
Edward L. Keenan and Bernard Comrie noted that these roles can be ranked cross-linguistically in the following order from most accessible to least accessible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subject &amp;gt; Direct Object &amp;gt; Indirect Object &amp;gt; Oblique &amp;gt; Genitive &amp;gt; Object of comparative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This order is referred to as the accessibility hierarchy. If a language can relativize positions lower in the accessibility hierarchy, it can always relativize positions higher up, but not vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…[/quote]
This kind of thing is a great thing for conlanging: we can choose to break it if we’re feeling sparky, or just choose our point on the scale. I’m going to choose the latter since there are sound human/intuitive reasons for the order. Another cool factoid is that those languages which cannot relativize stuff lower on the scale are precisely the languages whose passives pick up the semantic slack. With that in mind, because passives are fun too, let’s choose somewhere middling on the scale so both can eventually get some spotlight:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kjáhida allows relative constructions for antecedents in the &lt;strong&gt;Subject&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Direct Object&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Indirect Object&lt;/strong&gt; roles.
Kjáhida uses passive constructions for antecedents in the &lt;strong&gt;Oblique&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Genitive&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Comparatand(?)&lt;/strong&gt; roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, we still need to decide what exactly these constructions will consist of. I’m quite a fan of gap constructions (“The man (I saw) was fat”), so we certainly want those, but it’s useful to have some kind of relativizing particle to deal with trickier scenarios: we’ll define an indeclinable ‘di’ for the purpose. There are four scenarios I want to handle explicitly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1)The antecedent is the ‘first’ argument of the matrix verb, and the ‘first’ argument of the subordinate verb.
2)The antecedent is the ‘first’ argument of the matrix verb, and &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the ‘first’ argument of the subordinate verb.
3)The antecedent is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the ‘first’ argument of the matrix verb, and &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; the ‘first’ argument of the subordinate verb.
4)The antecedent is not the ‘first’ argument of either verb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason I want to be sure of those cases is because we have to concern ourselves about parsing the ‘crumbly’ bits of our verbs, so best to be methodical. For ‘non-first’ roles, we more precisely mean arguments entailed by a verb being semantically ‘transitive’ or ‘ditransitive’, since we said we only relativize Indirect Objects and above in the accessibility hierarchy. (Side-note: we need to address the ‘optionality’ of verbs’ preposition-headed arguments soon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For cases 1) and 3), I think we can very handily get away with a simple ‘plop it in’ strategy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1)
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sja sam sir rakási ja namam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;be go-toward(come) potato be yumminess&lt;/em&gt;
The potato that came was yummy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;win Sakir ja sam sir rakási&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;eat Sakir of go-toward(come) potato&lt;/em&gt;
Sakir ate the potato that came&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parsing the construction is pretty natural, as the verb of the relativized clause shows up right after any ‘prepositions’ where a noun’d be expected, so it’s clear what is going on. We may need to cook up some strategies for fronting non-relativized phrases to clear up some ambiguity that occurs with a ‘heavy’ subclause, but it’s nothing English and others can’t handle, so we can look to them for inspiration when we address that issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For cases 2) and 4), I feel more comfortable inserting a ‘dummy pronoun’ in the  subclause, and have the NP itself exit to the left of the verb:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2)
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sam nit lir Sakir ja di sir tatíra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
_go girl saw Sakir of REL towards dog _
The girl that Sakir saw went up to the dog&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4)
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;dawi Sakir lek tímitim mal Táti min di&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;throw Sakir away/from stick place Spot down REL&lt;/em&gt;
Sakir threw out the stick that Spot had placed down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, to help our Kjáhida-speakers out a bit, we’ll introduce a pragmatic shuffling rule: the ‘&lt;preposition&gt; di&#39; segment should occur last in the subordinated clause as long as it doesn&#39;t introduce ambiguity of the meaning of those phrases it &#39;moves to the right of&#39;. This is mostly important for ditransitive verbs with several arguments required:&lt;/preposition&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sjin Sakir wi tímitim sir Táti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;give Sakir of stick to Spot&lt;/em&gt;
Sakir gave the stick to Spot&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;goes to &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;lir Ríta ja tímitim sjin Sakir sir Táti wi di&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;saw Rita of stick give Sakir to Spot of REL&lt;/em&gt;
Rita saw the stick that Sakir had given Spot&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;lir Ríta ja tímitim sjin Sakir wi di sir Táti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;saw Rita of stick give Sakir of REL to Spot&lt;/em&gt;
Rita saw the stick Sakir gave (toward Spot?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rule will come in handy when we have longer, more involved sentences: the ‘di’ forms a natural kind of ‘end parenthesis’ in most cases. However, ambiguity can still exist if there are PP’s and such in the subclause (the shuffling rightwards won’t happen because it’ll often seem like we’re relativizing an oblique object), but context should normally sort out the right parsing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, I’ve been working on this post for two hours, so I’m going to end it there. I’m sure there are cases I’ve not looked at for our relative clauses, but I’m feeling good about it so far. Call me out on anything stupid/ambiguous if you see it, and I’ll try and address it. If we catch anything egregious, my next post will be about addressing it, otherwise I’ll likely think about the passive constructions next, leaving finer details for later. As always, thanks for reading this stuff: it’s very much appreciated, even if you don’t end up commenting.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Prepositional Phrases</title>
   <link href="http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/kyahida/2014/02/15/Honest%20To%20Goodness%20Prepositional%20Phrases"/>
   <updated>2014-02-15T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/kyahida/2014/02/15/Honest To Goodness Prepositional Phrases</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I’ve been writing these posts and coming up with the grammar for Kjáhida, I feel I’ve ben focusing on the verb-like behaviour of the non-NP elements in our sample sentences. However, since the goal is to create a language based on Killer-P’s, we need to make sure they are clearly acting as prepositions as well. Doing some research (thus no post yesterday), I came across a neat thing in Chinese that I think is going in the right direction.[quote=”about.mandarin.com”]
The Mandarin Chinese particle zài - 在 has several functions. It is most commonly used to indicate location. When used before a place word, zài means “on” “at” or “in”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shū zài nàli. 
The book is there. 
书在那里｡&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zài is also used as a preposition to indicate where an action takes place:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tāmen zài chúfáng chī dōngxī. 
They are in the kitchen eating.
他们在厨房吃东西｡&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another use for zài - 在 is to show that an action is occurring at the present moment. Zài is placed before the verb it modifies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tāmen zài kàn diànshì. 
They are watching TV. 
他们在看电视｡
[/quote]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also a lot, after I thought a bit, like English ‘at/a-‘, such as in “I’m at the store” and “I’m a-running home!”. This is the kind of multi-use I want Kjáhida Killer-P’s to do regularly. So to start with, in today’s post, we’re gonna come up with some basic prepositional particles (including ones we’ve already used), and keep in mind alternate uses we can declare out-of-the-box. We’re also gonna assign a heirarchy of semantics for determining which prepositional phrases are ‘fronted’, occurring closer to the verb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Lineup&lt;/strong&gt;
This list is only for the meanings of these particles when they are not working with another Killer-P and as such are not complete definitions. They are presented in order of salience, and should be nearer to the verb in an ‘unmarked’ word order than those PPs below it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Participant Particles: Highest Default Salience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
ja - of, characterized by
wi - of, concerning/related to
sir - toward, with the natural endpoint being
lek - from, with the natural startpoint being
kja - for, to the interest/benefit/detriment of
liswá - with, accompanying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Locational/Environmental Particles: Medium Default Salience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
kwa - moving over, past; to the detriment of
nar - moving under, beneath; with X in mind; to the benefit of
kjiri - above, atop
min - below, under
swiswi - with respect to, along; following with
nísam - against, upon; abutting, adjacent &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Temporal Particles: Lowest Default Salience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
liswá - while, at the same time as X (yup, liswá is in both lists)
daji - before, with X haven’t happened yet
sjak - after, with X having happened already
wa - along with, with X beginning at the time of the action
kin - parting from, with X ending at the time of the action&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun to do, easy to do, useful to do: a winning combination! So how do we use them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Prepositional Phrase&lt;/strong&gt;
Thinking over the question from last post and after some reading/research, it seems very natural for all verbs to have a set of semantic parameters that get filled in, and that it is usually the choice of the language which ones to make mandatory. With that in mind, I’m going to take a loose approach largely consisting of the maxim “If the verb used comes built-in with Killer-P’s, they are required to show: if there are no arguments to take, they stay in front of the main argument”. This means I decided to go along with the ‘win ja’ option last post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means for us today is that any prepositions ‘built into’ the verb come first, followed by the heirarchy of prepositions we specified above, which are optional. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;win ja Sakir&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;eat-of Sakir&lt;/em&gt;
Sakir Eats&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;win Sakir ja rakási&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;eat Sakir of potato&lt;/em&gt;
Sakir ate a potato&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;win Sakir ja rakási liswá Rita&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;eat Sakir of potato with/at-the-same-time-as Rita&lt;/em&gt;
Sakir ate a potato with Rita&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;win Sakir wi rakási kin dawi Rita ja tímitim nar Táti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;eat Sakir TOPIC potato parting-from throw Rita of stick for Spot&lt;/em&gt;
Sakir began eating a potato once Rita threw a stick for Spot (topic will shift to the eating of the potato: unpalatable? delicious?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoa whoa whoa…. we just introduced a whole subclause (‘kin dawi Rita…’) with that last one: very controversial at this early stage! All sorts of English-isms could abound here, so I’ll have to think on that one in particular for an upcoming post. That said, it doesn’t seem that offensive, and I like how it shows the usefulness of “kin” for tying together events. We’ve already come a long way from “Spot is a dog”, don’t you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing very wild was introduced today: we had a good ol’ sit down with some semantically straightforward prepositions. However, this is in anticipation of overloading them in the use of constructions I’ve yet to come up with: I see lots of potential for making some mark verbal inception, marking ditransitive setups (and we’re already seeing ‘ja’ acting as a de facto ‘patient’ marker), and perhaps even things like evidentiality. If you have a spiffy suggestion, or wisdom about what other (con)langs do, I’m all ears!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, thanks for taking the time to read!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constructions in this Post&lt;/strong&gt;
PP -&amp;gt; &lt;preposition&gt; &lt;np&gt;
PP -&amp;gt; &lt;preposition&gt; &amp;lt;Subclause?&amp;gt;
PPs exist in a &quot;actor &amp;gt; location &amp;gt; time&quot; default heirarchy: higher-ups are said closer to the matrix verb.&lt;/preposition&gt;&lt;/np&gt;&lt;/preposition&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Transitive Syntax and Adjectives</title>
   <link href="http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/kyahida/2014/02/14/Mass%20Transitive"/>
   <updated>2014-02-14T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/kyahida/2014/02/14/Mass Transitive</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Part of being an expatriate is to find creative ways to not eat the local food. It’s not that I dislike Chinese food: far from it, I enjoy me some guōtiē. But sometimes I just want McDonald’s, and they deliver over here, right to your door, and it’s raining outside, and…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…I pour sriracha sauce on the fries. Bringing us to this post’s doozie of an intro sentence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;win Sakír ja tímitim rakási wi sjiráha&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;eat Sakir of stick potato with sriracha sauce&lt;/em&gt;
Sakir eats fries with sriracha sauce&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all of a sudden we’ve proposed at least three different constructions for Kjáhida without even trying: the joys of early conlang development! Let’s run an initial analysis, see if we like it, and determine any tweaks to be made. What have we done here…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-‘tímitim rakási’ is an NP with more than one noun in it, and is trying to associate the two words together to signify a different concept altogether. We need to be precise about this kind of thing, so this merits some dissection.
-‘ja’ is definitely indicating a Patient for this transitive verb concept: whether it is a distinct case marker that just looks like our previous ‘ja’ is yet to be determined.
-‘wi sjiráha’ could be an honest-to-goodness instrumental PP, a component of the matrix verb (‘win ja wi’?), or some other particle denoting the relevance of the sriracha, perhaps an adverbial of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yum&lt;/strong&gt;
We’ll go in order, starting with ‘tímitim rakási’. I figured it was a bit much to have ‘french fry’ &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; ‘sriracha sauce’ be in the first 10 words I made, so figured I could get some mileage out of having a word for stick (Táti needs fun in example sentences too) and force at least a quick look at NP constructions in Kjáhida. That said, I don’t think we need much going on here yet… this is like English “racecar”, “gunsight”, “shoelace” and so on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feels a little underwhelming to me, so we may revisit this, but for now I want to make juxtaposition a non-marginal method for Kjáhida speakers to associate two things, and we have such a lovely thing going on with ‘sja… sja…’ that I want to echo. So, I promise some more interesting NP constructions later, but not today. Only other thing to note here is that we’re considering ‘tímitim’ as the head of the phrase, and so the status of ‘rakási’ (currently) is that of a null-marked “the head is made up of/comprised of’ relationship, like French ‘de’/’en’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Impasse&lt;/strong&gt;
Moving on… what’s ‘ja’ up to? It’s not really the least obvious word to use, in its ‘of’ gloss. I think in church they even say things like “Drink of this wine, for it is my blood”, so there is some cognate friendliness going on here. So I guess the real question is if it is part of the matrix verb or a head of an adjunct phrase. If the language existed already, I’d ask to see what “I eat” translates to, then we’d see if we got ‘win ja Sakír’ or ‘win Sakír’: that’s the kind of stuff linguists do, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;win ja Sakír&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;eat of Sakir&lt;/em&gt;
?Sakir eats&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;win Sakír&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;eat Sakir&lt;/em&gt;
?Sakir eats&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a conlanger, however, this is a design choice. The choice I see here, at least while keeping to our patterns and themes, is a decision about how strongly verbs in Kjáhida expect certain semantic arguments to be present. If we go with ‘win ja Sakír’ in the intransitive, we’re closer to a stance emphasizing phrasal verbs crumbling toward relevant NP arguments, whereas ‘win Sakir’ goes more the route of our verbs not caring as much about the specifics of their actions, delegating the explanation to secondary phrases (and thus emphasizing our ‘killer preposition’ goal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, I’m genuinely divided on which way to go, so I’d appreciate feedback/opinions. If I had to choose a preference, I’d say I’m leaning towards ‘win ja Sakír’, so that it is easier to imagine straightforward Kjáhida words for English concepts like ‘eating in’, ‘eating out’, ‘eating it all up’, and so on: ‘win ja’ would mean exactly ‘eat of’. Lemme get your thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Yum&lt;/strong&gt;
Finally, we get to enigmatic ‘wi’ introducing my favorite condiment. That said, what does ‘wi’ actually indicate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this particular sentence, it might be tempting for the eager conlanger to label it “INSTRU.” or “with” in the gloss, clap their hands, and be done. But I’m not gonna give one of the shortest words in Kjáhida such a simple, angst-free existence! No, we’re gonna make this particle particle behave at least as promiscuously as the English word ‘to’, although in a different way: I propose that ‘wi’ indicates a pragmatic decision by the speaker to mention something particularly relevant to the action of the matrix verb. 
[size=1]You may wonder why I’m using the word ‘matrix’ all the time. It is because I want to get a headstart on my distinctions early on, since I’m allowing for/anticipating some wacky embedded-clause maneuvers later on[/size]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because, when I began this post, I didn’t just want to say “I-am-Sakir-and-I-eat-french-fries-with-sriracha-sauce”. I used ellipses and everything to focus on the sriracha, it was the reason I brought up the scenario at all; talking with friends, that’s the hook of the story. The only reason I didn’t say ‘wi sjiráha win…’ was that I’m uncomfortable performing grammatical fronting so early in development. So ‘wi’ is some amalgam of a ‘THEME’ or ‘TOPIC’ marker. So, I’m seeing ‘wi’ having a place in sentences like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;lir Sakír wi Ríta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;see Sakir the-lovely-and-talented Rita&lt;/em&gt;
Sakir saw Rita (and we’re gonna talk about Rita now)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sam Sakír wi Táti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;go Sakir with-the-going-very-relevant-to dog&lt;/em&gt;
Sakir went with Spot (since why would I bring up Sakir’s travels if it wasn’t important to the dog?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;rak Sakír wi sjiráha&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;have Sakir dat sriracha-sauce&lt;/em&gt;
Sakir has sriracha on him (and that’s gonna lead to something)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it’s almost like it glosses to “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;” right now, but that’s mostly my enthusiasm showing: I’ll be less excited about it later on and it’ll simply be a way for us to ‘promote’ an NP in pragmatic situations without resorting to a passive or similar construction. It also coyly leaves undetermined whether we can have NPs not be ‘headed’ by a particle of some form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

   <title>Introducing Phrasal Verbs</title>
   <link href="http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/kyahida/2014/02/13/Still%20Gettin'%20It"/>
   <updated>2014-02-13T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/kyahida/2014/02/13/Still Gettin' It</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dropped it pretty abruptly last time, so let’s resume: we were just about to do something interesting. So far, we’ve two basic constructions that are keeping their nose clean - the semantics involved aren’t too tricky, and I’ve not presented anything particularly outlandish. But wait–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ja Táti sja tína&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;characterized-by/of Spot be happiness&lt;/em&gt;
Spot became happy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yes. Although comfortably a preposition one post ago, ‘ja’ is now acting as the main matrix verb in this sentence, and ‘sja’ has been kicked over and is acting at best as a case marker or somesuch. Together, they unite to form the sense “become”. But what’s going on here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, perhaps we should start with our analysis so far. I’ve emphasized that the first particle in a sentence is the verb and (after its argument) following thereafter is a prepositional phrase (PP) acting as an argument. But I set out to do weird serial verb constructions, so why not look at it through this lens?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would we say “Spot became/changed”? I propose we &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do it like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ja sja Táti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;characterized-by/of be Spot&lt;/em&gt;
Spot became&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, ‘ja sja’ is (to my mind) gonna be like English phrases like “give in”, “pull out”, “rake in”, “give up”, and “take up”: they form lexical items that mean something different than their constituents. Thus, the actual meaning of ‘ja sja’ is ‘become’, not ‘of be’; I want to do this kind of thing for most Kjáhida verbs. In English, I could say “I gave up” or “I raked in the dough”: in Kjáhida, I want to do the same thing, but sprinkle in the NPs in there. So, instead of saying “I took up space” we’d (in gloss-o-nese) say “took I up space”. So perhaps a ‘better’ gloss to show what’s going on in today’s example would be like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ja Táti sja tína&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;-came Spot be- happiness&lt;/em&gt;
Spot became happy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at our (only… other… example…) “Spot is a dog”, let’s follow this pattern and guess that if we just wanted to say “Spot exists” we’d have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sja sja Táti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;be be Spot&lt;/em&gt;
Spot is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is that that would be too easy to understand to learners of the language, and we can’t have that: this ain’t no auxlang. Additionally, “be be” is silly to require at this point. Further, this is the word ‘to be’ in our language, and it is our duty to make it as oddball as we can get away with. Finally, we already said that the ‘sja … sja …’ construction was using juxtaposition! So, no, my friends, we’ll just keep it like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sja Táti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;is Spot&lt;/em&gt;
Spot is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important thing here is that we thought of that possibility and chose to go with a different pattern because it looked prettier. I propose for now (until we want to make a construction that messes things up) we should analyze the particle/verb/preposition things as set constructions that get filled in with NPs. In this light, we still basically just have done VS(O) sentences, just that the V has been kind of crumbly. In fact, I don’t think we’ve even done a ‘proper’ PP as a result of this analysis, which means we have even more design space to explore than we thought we did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be totally clear, I expect this analysis to change as we go forward: don’t feel too comfortable with ‘Oh! They’re all just part of a verb’. I’m pretty sure they’re gonna end up earning the ‘Killer P’ as we go along. However, the next post will cover those “Nice, active verbs” I mentioned but didn’t use last time: they are single-wordy, but surely they’ll need two arguments? No worries, we’re gettin’ it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback, pointing-out-of-stupidity, and comments (as always) welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Attributive Sentences</title>
   <link href="http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/kyahida/2014/02/12/Basic%20Sentences"/>
   <updated>2014-02-12T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/kyahida/2014/02/12/Basic Sentences</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Before we can get to the juiciest strategies for plopping appositive phrases in sub-relativized whojamacallits while referencing referents three sentences ago, we’re going to need three things:
-Some Kjáhida words, so we don’t have half-glosses
-Some typological decisions, so we can be consistent going forward
-A basic, prototypical, descriptive-tone sentence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Vocab&lt;/strong&gt;
So, with the caveat that these words could radically change if I muss with the phonology of Kjáhida (and that I’m not breaking my own rules already…), here are a bank of words I think should serve us well for now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe, Jane, and Spot: Sakír, Ritá, Táti
Kinds: sal(person), nis(boy), nit(girl), tatíra(dog)
Inanimate props: tímitim(stick), rakási(potato), sjiráha(sriracha sauce)
Not really nouns, but why not: tína(hapiness) lídja(sadness) kirikinís(quickness)
Nice, active verbs: sam(go) lir(see/apprehend) dawi(throw) win(eat) mal(put/place)
Finicky, less-active verbs: rak(have/possess) nisír(feel) sja(be)
Fun multivalent verbs: sjim(give) dan(make/cause) mihya(tell/say)
Killer-P’s that we’ll determine later: ja, wi, sir, kja, liswá&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Decisions&lt;/strong&gt;
In order to break our own rules intelligently later with our interesting irregularities, we need to set down our regular themes first. I’ve always found typological decisions to be very productive in shaping how I approach the creation of structures in my linguistic doodlings, so here are some parameters I’ll declare here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Head Initial_&lt;/strong&gt; phrase structure. We’re gonna follow English’s lead and have our prepositions, determiners, demonstratives, and so on come first in their phrase.
-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VSO&lt;em&gt;** structure. Verb-first has always been something I’ve liked, and it appeals to the computer programmer in me. Further, I have plans for prepositions &amp;amp; verbs, so I want to echo the Head-Initial decision here to make life easier down the line.
-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Pro Drop&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Unless this becomes too cumbersome, we want there to be lots of dropped arguments to verbs so that we can imply their presence with agreement elsewhere in the sentence with fun anaphora and such.
-_&lt;/strong&gt;“As we go” morphological alignment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. We’ll see how interesting we can get word order to be, but I’m not focused on attaining a particular alignment: we’ll likely be nominative-accusative with some lexically-determined switching.
-&lt;em&gt;**‘Noun oriented’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. If I could get away with it, we’d be having ‘verbs’ be a closed class; I want some flexibility here, though, so we’ll just say we intend to convey most information through non-main-verb phrases.
-&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serial/Phrasal Verbs_&lt;/strong&gt;. I want to make verbs really have to cooperate with each other and prepositions and clitics to get anything done. Not only are we going to do stuff like make “tell give in make” mean “to shame into charity” or whatever, but we’re going to do it frequently.
-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Vague”_&lt;/strong&gt;. By this I mean that we aren’t going to be overly concerned with marking tense, gender of participants, aspect, or evidentiality in the creation process unless it is relevant and/or provides an interesting grammatical construct. Like any language, we’ll be able to indicate these things, but I’m not gonna prioritize a ‘declension table’ early on, and the glosses will play a little loose with the distinctions when not relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic Sentence&lt;/strong&gt;
All that sounds real fun and all, but there are poor imaginary people who need to say things like “Spot is a dog”, so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sja Táti tatíra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;be Spot dog&lt;/em&gt;
Spot is a dog&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verb-Subject-Object, yawn. I dislike that tatíra isn’t associated with a killer preposition or verb. So, instead of being sad about that, we’ll change it to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sja Táti sja tatíra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
be Spot be dog
Spot is a dog&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re gonna just plop another ‘be’ by ‘dog’ and use the magic of juxtaposition for “instance of” constructions. We say “Spot is.” along with “Dogs are.” and let the speaker assume for us that these facts are related: Kjáhidans of course see that “Spot is a dog” is the presumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, this makes for a more natural progression to other basic-styled sentences. Not only is Spot a dog, I’d like this imaginary canine to be psychologically fulfilled and have an appropriate balance of hopes and expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sja Táti ja tína&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;be Spot characterized-by/of happiness&lt;/em&gt;
“Spot is happy”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“ja” attributes a quality to the main argument to the verb, because it was the first free word in our ‘killer preposition’ list, and we needed a word here. Note that, due to the semantics I have in mind here, we don’t want to use it for our last sentence, as here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sja Táti ja tatíra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;be spot characterized-by/of dog&lt;/em&gt;
“Spot is doglike”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a cat as a child that was a dog in all behavioural respects but he wasn’t in actuality, and so I might use this construction to describe him as ‘dog-like’ or ‘has the characteristics of a dog’ but it’d be inaccurate and unethical to use “sja tatíra” with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking this as a pattern, we’re gonna let verbs all have a set of feasible prepositional arguments that may or may not appear in any given utterance (like just about every other language ever). Right this second, I’ll say that we always put the most ‘Agent-like’ argument of the verb right after the verb… but I plan some complexity/flexibility once we get more complex ‘verb-al’ elements into our sentences, as well as some passivization ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post, however, has taken longer to write up than I had budgetted time for so I’ll leave it at this for today. Feedback and such is welcome as always.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>New Language - Kjáhida</title>
   <link href="http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/kyahida/2014/02/11/New%20Language%20Kja%CC%81hida"/>
   <updated>2014-02-11T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/kyahida/2014/02/11/New Language Kjáhida</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ahoy! It’s well past the point where I should post something about my new language of the past month. I’ve recently moved to China again, and (as seems to be a symptom) learning another language makes me want to retreat into conlanging. I’m putting this in Quickies to incentivize regular posting, and I’ll be using this topic to present an unordered creation of the grammar. The language is provisionally named ‘Kjáhida’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concept&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal is to make a language that exhibits a high degree of syntactical depth: the goal is to have a syntax that is well-detailed and presents several interesting structural features, without becoming a kitchen-sink of strategies. I don’t care overly for phonology or morphological processes, so will be aiming for simplicity there: the language will be highly analytic and I’ll not be investigating much phonological nuance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important point of interest for me is to have ‘killer prepositions’: I want a robust class of adposition-verb-thingies that fly around sentences acting as coverbs, relativization strategies, semanti-clitics… all sorts of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obligatory Phonology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Languages need sounds, so I cobbled together a relatively simple phonology that is sufficiently simple and ‘edgy’ at the same time. Where I dont’ explicitly mark // vs. [], I mean //.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its main unorthodox feature is a 2-vowel system:
V = /i a/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The front vowel /i/ is prototypically unrounded and reduces in fast speech to the neighborhood _, whereas the back vowel /a/ tends to be rounded and moves towards schwa. Roundedness is determined by vowel-height as far as I am concerned for now, and I don’t imagine speakers tend to care about it much, particularly for more ‘central’ vowel allophones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consonants&lt;/strong&gt; are pretty tame, and my analysis splits them into ‘front’ and ‘back’ consonants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;front&lt;/sub&gt; = /j d s m l/
C&lt;sub&gt;back&lt;/sub&gt; = /w k h N r/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Words&lt;/strong&gt; in Kjáhida follow this regular expression for now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(K&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; | K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;i | K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;a)+(dksmNlr)
where
K&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; = dksh(jw)
K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = C&lt;sub&gt;front&lt;/sub&gt;khr
K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = C&lt;sub&gt;back&lt;/sub&gt;dsm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress&lt;/strong&gt; is determined lexically. Stressed syllables acquire a higher volume and round the vowel when its pitch is low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allophony&lt;/strong&gt;
Allophony is only somewhat laid out at this point, and mostly is a basic set of rules about what the actual allophone of the two vowels should manifest as based on context. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;openness/height&lt;/strong&gt; of the vowel is centralized if the frontedness of the vowel matches the class of consonant: C&lt;sub&gt;back&lt;/sub&gt;a shifts /a/ towards [o], and C&lt;sub&gt;front&lt;/sub&gt; shifts /i/ towards _.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pitch&lt;/strong&gt; is prominent in the sound of the language, but is not featural. It has four general levels: high, mid-high, mid, and low. It is determined per-syllable, and follows directly from the phonemes involved according to the following schema:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;back&lt;/sub&gt;i#, C&lt;sub&gt;front&lt;/sub&gt;aC&lt;sub&gt;front&lt;/sub&gt; –&amp;gt; High
C&lt;sub&gt;front&lt;/sub&gt;i#, C&lt;sub&gt;front&lt;/sub&gt;aC&lt;sub&gt;back&lt;/sub&gt; –&amp;gt; Mid-High
C&lt;sub&gt;front&lt;/sub&gt;iC&lt;sub&gt;front&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;back&lt;/sub&gt;iC&lt;sub&gt;front&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;back&lt;/sub&gt;aC&lt;sub&gt;front&lt;/sub&gt; –&amp;gt; Mid
C&lt;sub&gt;back&lt;/sub&gt;iC&lt;sub&gt;back&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;back&lt;/sub&gt;aC&lt;sub&gt;back&lt;/sub&gt; –&amp;gt; Low&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semivowels&lt;/strong&gt; reduce when they occur at the beginning of a word: jV goes to V and wV goes to ?V. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very open to suggestions about the phonology, as it is certainly not my forté (the ‘pitch’ thing is particularly alien ground for me). I intend to move on to grammatical considerations as soon as possible (I have several notes, but not condensed into postable format) and will likely make a post on basic sentence structure in the coming day or so.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>System - Possible Movement Mechanic</title>
   <link href="http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/nendsame%20rpg/2012/10/27/System%20-%20Possible%20Movement%20Mechanic"/>
   <updated>2012-10-27T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/nendsame%20rpg/2012/10/27/System - Possible Movement Mechanic</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today’s post is about the movement system I’ve decided to use in the game. It ended up being a bit simpler than I had originally intended, and hopefully translates well to gameplay, whether the game utilizes a tabletop or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each character has a Move skill, which functions as a regular skill in every respect: you can improve your proficiency, learn special Move actions, and so on. The Move Action is available by default each turn as one of your action options. This action covers several kinds of maneuvers, such as rushing over a distance, scaling a surface, jinking and dodging, as well as exceptional modes like swimming, flying, and teleporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you use a Move action, you declare the intention and method of your transit. Then, depending on any obstacles, you will roll against a difficulty or opposed roll. Common rolls include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rush:&lt;/strong&gt; You simply want to cover ground as fast as prudently possible. Your degree of success represents how many units of distance you cover, and a failed roll can be interpreted as either a delay or damage from a fall (depending on the terrain). Open, easy terrain has a difficulty of 2. If jumping, you can convert each degree of success into 1 meter of height or distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scale:&lt;/strong&gt; You want to clamber over an obstacle or climb up a vertical surface. This is very similar to a Rush action, except the consequences for failing are usually more dangerous and you cover less distance per degree of success. Scaling a wall is also usually an opposed roll. A wall with many handholds usually presents an opposed difficulty of 2 dice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jink/Dodge&lt;/strong&gt;: Use this movement option to dodge danger, such as an incoming attack or falling debris. This can represent dodging for cover, skillfully ducking aside, and other sudden evasive movements. Simply roll your Move skill against the incoming attack: you may thus use your Move skill in lieu of your Fight skill, although you deal no counterattack damage should you succeed. Instead, you may move a unit of distance for each degree of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swim/Fly/Levitate/etc:&lt;/strong&gt; You can gain access to various special modes of movement which let you move in a non-terrestrial manner. When you learn these techniques, they will tell you their details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All characters start with the default speed unit for these actions, 2 meter (or about 6 feet). The ‘board’ is assumed to be non-gridded, but a grid layout with 2-meter hexes/squares seems like it could work: I’ll have to see what feels best in gametesting. What follows is a playtest I ran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Sunker&quot; Kuranai
Sakire Courier
HP: 10 (3 Wounds)

Skills:
Move: 3
---Jink(Move): +1
Fight: 2
Talk: 3&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hero, Sunker, is panicking. Cornered by a pack of golems in the form of winged wolves on a narrow skyway is the last place an inter-village messenger wants to be. Sunker knows he doesn’t stand a chance in combat against the three beasts, and desperately looks around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #00ccff;&quot;&gt;“Is there a rope off of the bridge I can escape down?” Inquire roll:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;2 (No).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunker looks down and sees only a few spherical silos a couple dozen meters down. The golem-wolves methodically encroach within 5 units, wings beating in anticipation. Sunker decides to &lt;span style=&quot;color: #00ccff;&quot;&gt;Rush 3&lt;/span&gt; the wolves to gain a running start to try to jump his way past them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rolling an amazing 11, he moves celeritously across the well-paved bridge (difficulty 2), covering up to 9 units of distance. Dashing 5 units to the wolves, and then exchanging 4 units of running for a long jump over the wolves (1 unit up, 2 units over, 1 unit down), Sunker has successfully cleared the golems, who spin on their heels to attack him before he gets away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The golems lift up in a half-flight as they &lt;span style=&quot;color: #00ccff;&quot;&gt;Rush 3&lt;/span&gt; to engage him. They all easily succeed in gaining the 1 unit of distance between themselves and Sunker. All three use their second action to Fight our hero!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first snaps its maw, red activation lights running along its wings. The golem rolls&lt;span style=&quot;color: #00ccff;&quot;&gt; Fight 3&lt;/span&gt;, and Sunker elects to &lt;span style=&quot;color: #00ccff;&quot;&gt;Jink 4&lt;/span&gt; out of the way. The golem succeeds by 2, doing 5 damage to Sunker!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second one does the same, rolling &lt;span style=&quot;color: #00ccff;&quot;&gt;Fight 3&lt;/span&gt; while Sunker &lt;span style=&quot;color: #00ccff;&quot;&gt;Jinks&lt;/span&gt; again. Sunker wins be 3, gaining 3 units of distance from the wolves as he rolls away from the onslaught. This forces the third wolf to closely &lt;span style=&quot;color: #00ccff;&quot;&gt;Rush&lt;/span&gt; him (easily covering 3 units on open ground).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunker, having distanced himself from two of the three wolves, breaks into a full-on run. Sunker rolls an 11 on his &lt;span style=&quot;color: #00ccff;&quot;&gt;Move 3&lt;/span&gt; action, and the wolf tries to Intercept with its fight skill, rolling a 9. This means Sunker gains 2 units of distance successfully, and he hits his stride with a second &lt;span style=&quot;color: #00ccff;&quot;&gt;Move&lt;/span&gt; action covering 6 additional units: he might be able to escape!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three wolves break into pursuit, the blank stare of their metal eyes focused in on Sunker like a sniper’s scope as they &lt;span style=&quot;color: #00ccff;&quot;&gt;Rush&lt;/span&gt;. They roll 7, 8, and 9, resulting in Sunker being 2 units away from most of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skyway leads into a tower complex, and Sunker looks around for a way to ditch the golems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #00ccff;&quot;&gt;“Is there a ledge nearby overlooking a deepwater pool?”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #00ff00;&quot;&gt;Inquiry: 5 (Yes).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inside of the building dark but wide, Sunker sees an enormous pool in the floor below, the current level being a mezzanine overlook. Without a second thought, Sunker sprints to the bannister!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rolling 8 on his&lt;span style=&quot;color: #00ccff;&quot;&gt; Move&lt;/span&gt; as his second action, he is able to reach the bannister. With all the momentum of his run carrying him, he plants his two hands on the railing, pushes up, and throws his feet out in front of him in a feet-first dive into the open air, splashing into the water below!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do the wolves fly down after him? Can they swim in water? Who knows: that’s where this playtest ends!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>System - Possible Fight Mechanic</title>
   <link href="http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/nendsame%20rpg/2012/10/12/System%20-%20Possible%20Fight%20Mechanic"/>
   <updated>2012-10-12T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/nendsame%20rpg/2012/10/12/System - Possible Fight Mechanic</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been running some playtests to figure out a satisfying way&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to run bread &amp;amp; butter combats in the roleplaying game. I have a
couple objectives:
&amp;lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&amp;gt;1. Never have a meaningless “miss”
2. A complex attack should nonetheless be simple to ‘bookkeep’
3. Emphasize tactical movement without requiring a grid/minis&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
The idea I came up with for doing a basic attack (whether with
a femur or a pistol) is to smush together the gestalt result of
the strike all into one opposed roll. The difference of the
opposed results is then credited as a success to whomever won.
My thinking is that each weapon has a base damage, and you add
the degree of success to the final dealt damage. An example
playtest follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Saribke has been avoiding a stalking golem for half a day now,
but has stumbled into a cul-de-sac where the predator has
cornered him! The golem is eight meters tall, a gangly thing
that would surely be covered in coarse bristly fur if it was a
thing of flesh: the juts in its face recall a cat stuck in a
downpour.

Saribke uses an action to Inquire&lt;span style=&quot;color: #00ffff;&quot;&gt; &quot;Is there an apparent weak &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: #00ffff;&quot;&gt;spot I can strike on the golem with my polearm?&quot;&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style=&quot;color: #00ff00;&quot;&gt;5 (Yes)&lt;/span&gt;. The
golem is vulnerable to strikes focused on a shoddy power
coupling on its pelvis: get +2 to Fight rolls if you make a
successful Senses check (DN 5).

Saribke uses an action to perform a Senses check to see the
weak spot: he rolls a 7, so notices the vulnerability. He also
sees the golem charge toward him (Move + Fight)!

The golem has colossal fists (7 damage), and uses a Pummel
attack (Rating 4). Saribke raises his polearm (4 damage) to
block, using his Fight skill (Rating 7 including the
vulnerability of the golem... Saribke is very skilled). They
roll their dice, with the golem getting 8 and Saribke getting
11. The difference is 3 in Saribke&#39;s favor!

Saribke skillfully dodges aside, the haft of his polearm
deflecting a swipe from the golem, and brings the business-end
of the weapon against the golem&#39;s pelvis in a counterattack.
Saribke does 4 damage from his polearm rating, and 3 extra
damage from his degree of success for a total of 7 damage
against the golem (on the golem&#39;s turn!). Now it is Saribke&#39;s
turn, where he will likely press his advantage.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the counterattacking nature of this tactic, and
hopefully this’ll reduce the length of combats. It also might
result in combat being seen as the risky endeavor it is,
although I have some concerns about non-duel combat using this
mechanic: being mobbed might be very deadly, perhaps more than
I intend. For now, though, I’m happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>System - Possible Inquiry Mechanic</title>
   <link href="http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/nendsame%20rpg/2012/10/03/System%20-%20Possible%20Inquiry%20Mechanic"/>
   <updated>2012-10-03T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/nendsame%20rpg/2012/10/03/System - Possible Inquiry Mechanic</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking a lot about how to make my roleplaying game amenable to solitaire play: I want it to be easy to sit down with pen &amp;amp; paper on a boring afternoon, quickly toss together a character, and wander around Jezevel for a while. The previous playtest post was a transcript of me trying how to hash the process out: I didn’t know what’d happen next, although I set the initial scene and general objective before hand. I then proceeded by asking questions that popped into my head about the environment, which one would normally direct to a game master… but I had none, and didn’t want to really be one myself (I wanted to feel like a player, not a DM). So I stole a neat mechanic I’ve seen before, “Inquiry Dice”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Inquiry dice is a solution to the question “Well, how true is Proposition A?”: you roll a six-sided dice with sides mapping to “Yes”, “Yes, and…”, “Yes, but…” and their negative equivalents. You ask the question, the roll gives you the gist of the answer, and you elaborate on the consequences. For example, if I am confronted with a waterway in my travels, I can ask “Is the water safe to swim in?”. I then roll the Inquiry dice, and might get a “Yes, but” result: this means that I can swim in the waterway, &lt;em&gt;BUT&lt;/em&gt; there might be something to be wary of: this dice result could mean “Yes, but you can’t stay in its icy waters for very long” or “Yes, but you aren’t sure that there aren’t dangerous fish in it” or so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But” means the answer has a caveat that lessens its potency, while “And” means the answer is even more true than anticipated. If I ask “Is it raining outside?”, a “No, And” could mean “No, it’s not raining and is indeed quite hot out”. “No, but” could mean that there wasn’t any precipitation, but there are still puddles around. Pretty straightforward really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when you don’t really know what should happen next in the course of play, kick out a question and brainstorm on its result: that’s how I did my short 15-min playtest, and it came out alright I think (it’d’ve gone quicker, but I was typing it all up). The important thing to remember is to keep the scope of the question pretty straightforward: keep it simple!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my playtest, I made each roll of the Inquiry dice cost one of the two actions you get each turn: I figured this’d keep me from cheesing the freedom of the dice too much. I think it might end up being kind of interesting to keep the Inquire action as an in-game action, and I’ll have to see if it would survive in multi-player, no DM play.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Playtest - Semsa Cae's Rescue Attempt I</title>
   <link href="http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/nendsame%20rpg/2012/09/29/Playtest%20-%20Semsa%20Cae's%20Rescue%20Attempt%20I"/>
   <updated>2012-09-29T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/nendsame%20rpg/2012/09/29/Playtest - Semsa Cae's Rescue Attempt I</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;My character is named Semsa, a male Sakire who serves as a scout for his village. He was raised in House Cae, a minor but respectable house in the community which itself is a member of the Messokai Clan. Here are his stats:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semsa Cae
(Sakire Burgher Scout)
Body 3, Mind 3, Social 2, Senses 4 (12 HP)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skills:
Reading &amp;amp; Writing
Persuading a Reluctant
Talking to Officials
Making Friends
Climbing
Quickly Hiding in Cover
Fighting Small Golems
Reacting Suddenly to Danger
Fighting with Rifles &amp;amp; Bows
Clambering over Obstacles
Aiming a Weapon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possessions
Kakisme Rifle (12 shots. Range 30, 10 Damage, 2 Action to shoot)
50 gold&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start the story, I choose an initial goal that explains why Semsa is the focus of an adventure. I decide that he has been charged with finding a village girl who has been kidnapped by bandits, and he has found their hideout in a mazeway. I decide to begin play on a balcony overlooking their base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Is there an easy way down to their base?” Inquire = 5 (Yes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The balcony is actually a landing on an exterior staircase on the side of a tall building next to the bandit’s abode. The staircase terminates right at a side door to the hideout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I try to sneak down the stairs, keeping an eye out for any visible bandits. How does that go?” I roll 4, and figure the task is fairly easy (+2 DC), so I roll Senses vs. 6: I get a 6, just barely succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semsa cautiously slips his way down to the stairway’s bottom, rushes to the side door, crouches, and places his ear to the door, rifle drawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Do I hear anything on the other side of the door?” Inquire = 4 (Yes, but).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the frosted glass door Semsa hears nothing except for a quiet purr of some kind. Semsa decides to crack open the door and continue. The room appears to be a pantry of some sort, a large table in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Is there a sleeping golem watchdog under the table?” Inquire = 6 (Yes, and).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underneath the table is a lean golem, who appears to be waking up: the orange activation lights running in a line down its neck are turning red at Semsa’s presence as it stands to its legs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I choose the “Generic Agile Small Golem” profile: Body 4, Senses 3, Mind 0, Social 0 with Climbing, Fighting Intruders (5 damage), and Surviving Surprises. HP 20, no wounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semsa, startled by the golem, brings his rifle up and shoots (Senses vs Body), using both of his actions for his turns. He rolls 8, one more than the golem’s reaction of 7(4 from body, 3 from defending). The slug pounds through the golem’s side, doing 10 HP damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The golem pounces (a move), serratted metal claws reaching out (Body vs Senses attack) to end Semsa’s day. The attack rolls a 8 against Semsa’s 7, meaning Semsa is tackled by the ferocious monster, taking 5 HP damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scared and unable to fire the weapon at the golem, Semsa tries to figure out how best to kick off the golem. (Inquire action)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Is Semsa able to use his rifle to help defend himself?” Inquire = 5 (Yes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semsa uses his second action to fend off the golem by butting the rifle against it while trying to scuttle away (Move action, Body vs. Body check). Semsa rolls 7 vs 7, narrowly able to Disengage from the golem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The golem leaps, Semsa once again Engaged (due to the previous Disengage, however, this took up both of the golem’s actions). Semsa tries to brawl with the golem, rolls 8 on both of his attacks, relentlessly tearing at the golem’s wires and sensory equipment. The golem is low on HP, but fights just as ferociously as when it started: it succeeds in two attacks, doing another 5 HP each.Semsa opts to take a wound instead of one of the damages, bringing him down to two wounds and 2 HP!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fighting for his life, Semsa puts both his hands on the golem’s head and does two quick snapping motions (two Body vs. Body attacks). The first snap does nothing, but the second severs the metallic vertebrae, doing 4 HP damage, enough to disable the golem!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semsa curses himself for not bringing a close combat weapon, cradling his badly damaged arm. The shot from his gun must have alerted the bandits in the home, and Semsa levels his Kakisme toward the inner door on the other side of the room…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Does Semsa have time to catch his breath before the kidnappers come (if they chose to)?” Inquire = 5 (Yes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…taking a deep breath and focusing on the task at hand (HP restored, wound remains). A little girl needs to be saved, and he’s here to do so no matter what! Semsa quickly tries to figure out the next step, and slowly approaches the door with gun ready to blast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Are the Kidnappers waiting on the other side of the door ready to take him down?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find out next time :)&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/nendsame%20rpg/2012/09/26/Meta - In The Works!</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the past several days, I’ve been busy with personal business, so have not been able to focus on posting new content. However, this past weekend I &lt;strong&gt;did &lt;/strong&gt;finish the bulk of the short solo playtest adventure, and what remains is to create pre-generated characters, run through the adventure myself, and prettying the document up. Depending on how long this takes, it will either be tomorrow’s post or saved for the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to sharing the little adventure I wrote, and it has definitely provided some insights into changes I think I need to make to my system already. I’ll make sure to post a transcript of a playthrough at some point!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Character Option - Professions I</title>
   <link href="http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/nendsame%20rpg/2012/09/22/Character%20Option%20-%20Professions%20I"/>
   <updated>2012-09-22T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/nendsame%20rpg/2012/09/22/Character Option - Professions I</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post introduces some Profession backgrounds available to your character after they have chosen your Birth and Upbringing background. New characters start with up to two Profession backgrounds, and may acquire new ones during the course of play (unlike Births and Upbringings). When you select these backgrounds you must specify which is the most recent one: Professions usually confer an additional benefit at character generation if they are the most recent background. Today’s Professions are themed for middle-class Sakire in a well-to-do community, but feel free to add your own details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Merchant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You own or are associated with a small business, and handle day-to-day sales and management. This is usually a market stall at a local bazaar, where you pitch your wares and handle customers and money. You can either be a sole proprietor, or have a few employees that you manage. This background is primarily for a retailer of sundries, rather than a smithy or other producer of high-end capital goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is your most recent background at character creation, you start play with a single small business located in a village center. You can start with 0-3 employees who each cost 50$ per week while you are present, and 100$ per week if are absent (they can run the store while you are gone). The shop makes 100$-300$ worth of sales per week (determined by your GM, quality/quantity of employees, and/or story events). There is 50$ in weekly taxes and fees to the local government. You must restock your inventory: most often you can reliably produce/secure your product at 50% of the standard market price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have this as a background, you may gain Training in 3 of the following skills: Haggling &amp;amp; Appraising, Keeping track of details, Interacting with Officials, Interacting with Commoners, Performing calculations, Noticing pilfering and sneakers, Making a good impression, Crafting a specific material (bone, thread, leather, etc), Baking &amp;amp; Cooking, Gaining attention &amp;amp; Salesmanship. You also get a free 1XP, but it must be spent improving one of these three chosen skills or getting a fourth skill from this list. Finally, you start play with 200 gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scholar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are a specialist (whether as a hobbyist or as a professional) in a subject, and serve as an advisor or author to make your money. The most common kind of topics include archaeology, history, linguistics, literature, civil policy, and philosophy. This background represents a modest yet respectable expertise which is suitable either for advising officials and professionals on courses of action and meanings or for producing written works that are able to gain an audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have this as a background, you gain Innate Mastery in a single topic from the following list: Architecture, Archaeology(Precursor), Golems, Precursor Electricity, Precursor Linguistics, Civil Policy, Sakire Literature, Sakire History, Sakire Philosophy, Civil Engineering, Botany, Marine Biology, Weather, Optics, Kinematics, Geography, Avian Biology, Military Strategy, and other topics at your GM’s discretion. If this is your only Professional background at character creation, you also get 2XP to spend gaining/improving other topics in the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also gain Training in 2 of the following Skills: Teaching a subject, Reading &amp;amp; Writing, Sketching &amp;amp; Illustration, Seeing in the dark, Focusing amidst distraction, Explaining things to other people, Avoiding attention, Entertaining at an event. Finally, you start play with 5 good reference books on your topics, writing instruments, and 50 gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Guardsman&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are a member of the local citizen militia, which is charged with protecting your village from golems and to serve as a policing force. Your position is as a justice of the peace, and you answer to your local Guard Captain who himself is responsible to the local Imperial Prefect. Responsibilities include patrolling the village outskirts, responding to violent crimes, preventing theft at the local marketplace, and safeguarding the office of the Prefect. Each village gets a degree of local autonomy in local affairs in return for agreeing to host and pay taxes to their assigned Prefect, and the local citizen militia is formed to enable this relationship and keep the peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have this as a background, you gain Training in 3 of the following Skills: Calming members of the public, Noticing something amiss, Identifying lies and half-truths, Subduing a violent individual without performing harm, Intimidating members of the public, Interacting with Officials, Interacting with the Military, Fighting Golems. Additionally, you are Trained to fight and defend with polearms, swords, and shields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is your most recent background, you gain an affiliation with the local garrison, 25 gold, and either a polearm (of your choice) or a sword and shield. If not, you gain only the affiliation or the weaponry. If this is your only background, you are an officer and are either the captain’s Lieutenant or the garrison Sergeant: as either, you have access to 5-10 guardsmen for handling tasks of official importance. If this is your most recent background, you also have access to free but basic room &amp;amp; board at the local garrison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are a member of the local citizen militia, which is charged with protecting your village from golems and to serve as a policing force. You either volunteered or were drafted into an “Erikandre” (a kind of specialized semi-professional task force) serving as a scout. Your duties involve patrolling the wild beyond the village borders as a forward sentry to warn the village of impending raider and golem attacks. You are stealthy, well-versed in survival, and fulfill the roles generally associated with a wilderness ranger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have this as a background, you gain Training in 3 of the following Skills: Clambering over obstacles, Quickly hiding in cover, Navigating mazeways, Surviving falls from heights, Finding a safe place to rest, Fighting small Golems, Balancing on beams, Reacting suddenly to danger, Aiming a weapon, Acrobatic Running. Additionally, you are trained to fight with rifles and bows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You begin play with a Kakisme model rifle with 12 shots. If this is your only background, you gain 2XP to spend on skills from this background’s skill list. If this is your most recent background, you also have access to free but basic room &amp;amp; board at the local garrison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Soldier&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are a member of the Imperial Ceke Army, the infantry of the Emperor. Garrisons are located in larger communities across Jezevel, and the Army responds to large golem attacks, natural disasters, and rebellions. You either volunteered or were conscripted, and (unless specified otherwise by the GM) are a member of a regiment currently enjoying vacation time at your home village. As such you are free to engage in civilian activity until the regiment is activated, although you must report to your commander every three days. You have been trained in combat tactics, marching, and campaigning: you are considered to have finished at least one year of service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have this as a background, you gain Training in 3 of the following Skills: Finding a safe spot to rest, Intimidating civilians, Noticing an ambush, Navigating the city, Interacting with Officials, Interacting with the Military, Reacting to sudden danger, Maintaining combat awareness, Clambering over obstacles, Acrobatic running, Sneaking around. Additionally, you are trained to fight with rifles and polearms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You begin play with a Kare model partizan, a military affiliation, and a set of Plumata model armor. If this is your only background, you gain 2XP to spend on skills from this background’s skill list. If this is your most recent background, you also have access to free but basic room &amp;amp; board at the local garrison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Artisan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are a craftsman, specializing in a certain kind of craft. You perform your trade in a workshop, and sell your wares to local merchants for sale. The business is pretty flexible, since you choose your own hours, so you free to do whatever you want as long as your bills are paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have this as a background, choose one of the following materials to gain Mastery in: Bone, Leather &amp;amp; Furs, Scrap Metal, Stone, Wood, Iron/Steel, Gold/Silver, Bronze/Copper. Then, choose one of the following craft types to gain a Masterstroke in: sundries, containers/silverware, weapons, armor, jewelry, masonry, carpentry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You gain Training in 3 of the following Skills: Haggling with raw material dealers, Appraising &amp;amp; Identifying items of your chosen craft, Interacting with Merchants, Fighting with a hammer, Reacting quickly to an environmental hazard, Holding on tightly, Repairing an item, Breaking/Picking a lock, Making friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may begin play with 100 gold, a small workshop near the village center, an apprentice (if you wish), and a Supplier contact who you can go to for your materials, or you can liquidate and instead start play with 200 gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Performer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are a skilled entertainer who works hard to maintain and hone a particular performance talent. Choose to be an instrumentalist, singer, dancer, storyteller, or actor: you gain Innate Mastery whenever performing using that talent. You also gain Training in assembling and wearing costumes for looking your best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You gain Training in 3 of the following Skills: Interacting with Nobles, Making friends, Being the life of a party or gathering, Seducing a member of the opposite sex, Telling a lie, Reading a crowd, Fighting drunks, Attracting attention to oneself, Staying focused amidst distraction, Acrobatics, Climbing, Balancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may begin play with 50 gold, a personal promotion agent (if you wish), an above-average wardrobe, an instrument of value less than 50 gold, and a small apartment. If this is your only background, you gain 2 additional skills from the skill list, a minor noble patron, and enjoy wider fame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Acolyte&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are an acolyte of the Jeke, the official Imperial Cult. Your responsibilities include assisting the priestesses at the weekly rites, selling horoscopes, collecting tithes, and performing charity work. A normal village usually supports two priestesses and three to ten acolytes, who all receive living stipends from the Imperial Seat. The church reveres the Sky Bird, the God Below, and the animistic spirits of the Precursors. (More details about the religion will be published in a later update!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You gain Training in 3 of the following Skills: Astrology, Theology, History, Interacting with the Devout, Reading &amp;amp; Writing, Interacting with Officials, Selling fortunes &amp;amp; pardons, Fighting with a staff, Administering medical care, Calming a crowd. You also gain Training in Performing rituals, Comforting the distressed, and Guilt-tripping adherents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You begin play with 25 gold, 50 gold weekly salary, vestments, a Jeke affiliation, and a Priestess contact. If this is your only background, you are considered Chief Acolyte, gaining administrative duties for the local temple and a 25 gold salary raise. If you are no longer an active acolyte, you lose the salary and affiliation.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Character Option - Upbringings I</title>
   <link href="http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/nendsame%20rpg/2012/09/21/Character%20Option%20-%20Upbringings%20I"/>
   <updated>2012-09-21T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/nendsame%20rpg/2012/09/21/Character Option - Upbringings I</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today’s post provides some early-life backgrounds for your character, the Feral, Orphan, House(Whaler), and House(Burgher) Upbringings. Each of these presents a loose overview of the background you spent your formative years in, and not a straighjacket: the background mostly reflects the environment your character grew up in, what kind of opportunities and resources you had access to, and your default standing in that society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your character chooses any one Upbringing background (just as you choose only one Birth background), gaining all the benefits associated with it. Upbringings usually provide a wide variety of skills you can choose to gain, and can serve as prerequisites for certain later-life backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Feral&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You grew up alone amongst the mazes, avenues, and towers of the inner city. For one reason or another, you never integrated into a local village choosing instead to fend for yourself in the stony wild. This youth could have left you ferocious and untrustful, or perhaps instead simply shy and introspective. Regardless, you did not grow up within society, and thus prioritized survival skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things you might want to think about if you came from this background include: how did you survive? Why didn’t you end up joining a village? What was the scariest thing that happened to you when you were alone? How did you feel when you wandered the ruins?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your Upbringing was Feral, you may gain Training in 4 of the following skills, and you may begin play with a basic weapon of your choice (up to value 100, non-relic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skills: Clambering over obstacles, Quickly hiding in cover, Navigating mazeways, Surviving falls from heights, Finding a safe place to rest, Noticing signs of a guarded area, Fighting small Golems, Balancing on beams, Disarming a trap, Reacting suddenly to danger, Guessing which way to go in tunnel complexes, Intimidating commoners, Ambushing a guard, Foraging/Hunting for food&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Orphan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You grew up within a community, but your parents are either unknown or dead and no local House has formally adopted you. You may have grown up with an adoptive caretaker, a caring village, or living on the streets as a young urchin. In any event, you were reliant on unrelated people for your wellbeing and learned to adapt to the sometimes callous treatment of your peers. Because of the lack of House, your access to formal education was limited, but that simply freed you to interact with working adults and travellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things you might want to think about if you came from this background include: how did the village treat you? Do you know the fate of your parents? Were you well-mannered, or more of a scamp? Where did you sleep? Who was your best friend?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your Upbringing was as an Orphan, you may gain Training in 4 of the following skills, and you may begin play with 100 gold and a Contact in the village of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skills: Focusing on a task amidst distraction, Pilfering an item from someone, Persuading a reluctant individual, Fighting off bullies or drunks, Reading &amp;amp; Writing your language, Haggling and appraising an item’s price, Recognizing or Formulating a lie, Eavesdropping, Sneaking around, Entertaining others &amp;amp; Making friends, Crafting a particular mundane material (leather, thread, bone, etc), Reacting to sudden danger, Acrobatic running, Avoiding unwanted attention&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;House (Burghers)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You grew up as a member of a House, a social organization amongst the Sakire that bind together particular sets of families into a greater whole. Members within a house are treated as closely as biological family, along with all the benefits and obligations that entails. Your House is occupied by people of several different professions and talents, with most being clerks, salesmen, artisans, and craftsmen. Growing up in this environment, you had access to formal early education, giving way to some variety of apprenticeship when you were a bit older. You spent most of your days within a complex claimed by your house (a large villa, a tower, or some other retrofitted city structure) and passed the time bugging elders and cousins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things you might want to think about if you came from this background include: What activities did you feel drawn to? Were you a loner, or were you gregarious as a young one? Who tutored you? Did you prefer the familiar nature of the household, or the busy streets of the city more? How comfortable do you feel around your House members? Other Houses? Was your House isolationist, or involved daily with other Houses? What were the main dealings of your House?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your Upbringing was a member of a standard House, you may gain Training in 4 of the following skills, and you may begin play with 50 gold and a House affiliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skills: Reading &amp;amp; Writing, History, Playing a particular instrument of your choice, Crafting a particular mundane material (leather, thread, bone, etc), Lying, Baking &amp;amp; Cooking pastries and meats, Dancing, Singing, Persuading a reluctant individual, Climbing, Mathematics, Talking to officials, Focusing on a task amidst distraction, Making friends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;House (Whalers)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You grew up as a member of a whaling House, a social organization binding several whaling families together into a single whole. Jezevel’s waters are icy, but warm compared to the sea beyond the horizon, and thus flocks with large ocean mammals and fish. Members within a whaling House are dedicated to working together to bring in the bounty of the sea for sustenance and profit. Your House encourages friendly competition amongst its fishing crews, and provides a framework for negotiating disputes when they arise. You were very likely involved in their onshore operations at a young age, helping process fish and meat then helping their sale at market. Regardless of the path you choose when you grow older, you will always have free borrowed access to an unused whaling boat for whatever purposes you need, gratis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things you might want to ponder if you are a member of a whaling House include: Did you enjoy going out on the sea, or did you prefer the market atmosphere thereafter? Were your House members loud and energetic, or perhaps instead serious and taciturn? What was the biggest animal you ever caught? Do you have anyone in your House that holds a grudge against you, like a rival fishing crew? What has the most dangerous situation you ever found yourself in? Was it at sea or on shore? Do you still want to be associated with the whaling lifestyle?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your Upbringing was a member of a whaling House, you may gain Training in 4 of the following skills, and you may begin play with a 20 gold, a skiff (with standard tackle, including 4 harpoons) and a House affiliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skills: Reading &amp;amp; Writing, Haggling over the price of an item, Navigating at Sea, Sailing a boat, Fighting with polearms and spears, Preparing/Curing/Smoking meat, Lifting heavy objects, Crafting leather and bone, Balancing, Swimming, Identifying a beast and its instinctual behaviour, Singing, Creating a good atmosphere at a party or gathering, Reacting to sudden danger&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Character Option - Psyker</title>
   <link href="http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/nendsame%20rpg/2012/09/20/Character%20Option%20-%20Psyker"/>
   <updated>2012-09-20T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/nendsame%20rpg/2012/09/20/Character Option - Psyker</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A small but highly visible population of Sakire are born with no pupils in their eyes, and are thus completely blind. These individuals are said to be chosen by the gods to enact the will of the precursor civilization, and this could very well be true, for such a child is invariably gifted with magical abilities: these gifted individuals are called Psykers.This supernatural ability manifests primarily as an ability to perform feats of divination and psychic attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may choose the Psyker as your character’s Birth background. If you do so, you gain the special Psyker attribute at rank 1. This attribute is used whenever you try to overcome an obstacle using your talent for telekinesis and noticing the hidden energies of your environment. You are also born blind: you are unable by any means to gain the sense of sight. You may take Senses rolls at normal, except you suffer difficulty equivalent to being in utter darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psykers have access to several specialist schools which can serve to broaden your abilities, but each Psyker starts with two innate abilities. The first is telekinesis, which allows you to affect inanimate objects as if you were located adjacent to them. This ability has a range of approximately 20 feet, and requires line of sight. Using this power, you can do things like pull a lever, pick up a knife from a distant table&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Character Option - Sakire</title>
   <link href="http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/nendsame%20rpg/2012/09/19/Character%20Option%20-%20Sakire"/>
   <updated>2012-09-19T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/nendsame%20rpg/2012/09/19/Character Option - Sakire</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This character option is for players who want to be born without exotic traits, instead gaining the benefits of having to find their own innate talents. Nearly all the civilized population of Jezevel are Sakire, and choosing this option allows for the character’s fate to be less determined by the paranormal abilities of the likes of Imrais, Gemini, and Psykers. Sakire are the ones who most often man the boats, sell the wares, write the books, walk the beats, and perform the plays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a close similarity and nature to humans in our world, there are a few subtle differences. The everyman Sakire would seem to be ‘luckier’: things tend to work out more often than not. Even in a grim situation, small boons the Sakire happen upon smooth the tough times. Spare coins on the ground are discovered more often, lost keys are more likely to be hidden in a pants’ pocket, and so on. Some rare Sakire become so lucky that they can achieve marvelous feats in skills they’ve never tried, although most Sakire are nowhere near this fortunate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may choose Sakire as your Birth background. If you do so, you gain the special Luck attribute at rank 1. You may roll your Luck skill when you try to overcome an obstacle through sheer luck or serendipity. If you are performing an investigation, for example, and have no leads nor ideas, you might try to go to a bar and hope for a coincidental meeting with a witness: it’s not necessarily likely to work, but maybe for you! Your luck also becomes apparent when hurt: the cut on your throat will tend to not have hit your jugular vein, and such. Every turn, you may regenerate a number of hit points equal to your Luck attribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an additional choice, you may instead forfeit the surfeit of luck by not gaining the Luck attribute. In this event, you get +1 to any core attribute (Body, Mind, Social, Senses), and an extra Skill associated with your Upbringing background. This option is good for people who want their ‘luck’ to manifest in the skills they use, rather than the situations they escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sakire are well adapted to a myriad of tasks, backgrounds, and futures. They also get access to several cultural positions that are normally closed to non-Sakire, such as nobility and command positions in the military. Sakire are a great choice if you want a versatile blank-slate to create your character from, a heroic protagonist, or someone who can engage society on their own terms.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>System - Alpha Character Sheet</title>
   <link href="http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/nendsame%20rpg/2012/09/18/System%20-%20Alpha%20Character%20Sheet"/>
   <updated>2012-09-18T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/nendsame%20rpg/2012/09/18/System - Alpha Character Sheet</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, I’ve come up with a character sheet for use during the game’s alpha. My plan is to have some basic rules available for download this Sunday, so this is a sneak-peek of the general style I’m going for when it comes to the publication. For this blog, I have a personal goal to update every three times a week, and aim for Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday. Thursday’s post will likely contain a preview of a part of the game’s alpha rules, though I might just do a fun Character Option or Setting piece instead!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any event, the character sheet is available &lt;a href=&quot;http://jezzali.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Nendsame-Alpha-Character-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Character Option - Imrais</title>
   <link href="http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/nendsame%20rpg/2012/09/15/Character%20Option%20-%20Imrais"/>
   <updated>2012-09-15T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/nendsame%20rpg/2012/09/15/Character Option - Imrais</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, I’ve written up a Birth background available at character creation: the Imrais!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rarely, children are born in Jezevel that never utter a noise: neither while being born or any time after. Sounds around them dull, electric lights dim, and devices are jinxed or rendered inoperative. Psykers feel searing pain and a profound blindness around such children, and even an ordinary person feels a discomfort and unease. Such a child is called an Imrais, and has been gifted and cursed with a powerful aura that assails the magical and the technological.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You choose whether or not your character is an Imrais when you choose your Birth: one is either born with this alien aura or not, it cannot be learned. If you choose to be an Imrais, your character is born Mute: you are entirely unable to make any vocal or linguistic noises. You are capable of language, but may only read, write, and hear it. To reiterate, you are unable to yell, whisper, breath loudly, make a burping sound or any other sound that involves your respiratory tract. Imrais generally rely on facial expressions, small bells, handwriting, and sign language to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an Imrais you gain the special “Imrais” attribute: this represents the jinxing and anti-magic aura you possess. You use your Imrais attribute whenever you seek to overcome an obstacle by undermining magic or technology. All Psyker characters can feel your presence from 100 meters away, and suffer a penalty to any rolls they make using their Psyker attribute equal to your Imrais attribute while within 50 meters. In the event a Psyker is affected by multiple Imrais, only the penalty of the strongest Imrais is applied. Mechanical and electrical devices within 25 meters of you are considered Jinxed: they become extremely prone to randomly powering off, which can be both a bane and a boon depending on your situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imrais have a natural talent that is incredibly useful in hunting down rogue psykers and defending communities from Curators. Imrais are very rare individuals (roughly 1 in every 10,000 children is born an Imrais), and usually find themselves drafted into the military or bodyguard positions. Other than their aura, surreal silence, and oppressive presence they are not physically distinguishable from any other normal Citizen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imrais is an excellent choice if you want to be a literal headache for Psyker characters, a silent enigma, or a person with a troubled relationship with the ancient technology of Jezevel.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Character Option - Gemini</title>
   <link href="http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/nendsame%20rpg/2012/09/15/Character%20Option%20-%20Gemini"/>
   <updated>2012-09-15T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/nendsame%20rpg/2012/09/15/Character Option - Gemini</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is another Birth option for players: the Gemini!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery of a Gemini sends chills of apprehension up the collective spines of any normal community, an ill omen of bad fortune. A Gemini is a pair of identical twins, their origin invariably unknown, who are so closely bound in thought and spirit that they are better described as one soul trapped in two bodies. Normal twins have their own thoughts, feelings, and personalities, but this is startlingly less obvious in a Gemini. A player who wishes to play a Gemini is playing a character who owns two bodies, two minds, and a unified purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a prevalent belief that most Gemini are the result of an unknown horror possessing a pair of feral twins like marionnettes, that their sameness is an indication of outside control. This impression is not ameliorated by the fact that a common quirk is for a Gemini to speak in unison, or alternating each word spoken between bodies. Most Gemini will be shunned (and often run out of the boundaries of the village) when discovered, but some communities will shelter a Gemini (either out of sympathy, fear, or malice) and provide an upbringing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may choose Gemini as your Birth choice at character creation. If you choose to do so, your character gains the unique “Twinned” trait: as a player you control two bodies/individuals tied to one character sheet. As such, the bodies have the same attributes, skills, abilities, and physical characteristics as well as possessing a shared hit point pool, wounds, etc. If you wish to perform a skill, you may elect either body to perform it. Furthermore, if you take a second action but it originated from a different body than the first action did, it does not suffer the normal second-action penalty to rolls. Finally, if neither body was used for two actions, they may each assume a Stance at the end of your turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a Twinned character means you should be aware of some of the consequences of your doubled nature. The first basic principle, in terms of the mechanical game rules, is that you are considered a single unified character who is occupying two locations that need not be near each other. You can act from both locations, be targetted at both locations, see/feel/hear from both locations, and be damaged/healed/etc from both locations, and so on.
The second basic principle is that you don’t generally suffer ‘double jeopardy’, but you do suffer ‘stigmata’. If both of your bodies fall off a chasm or are encompassed in a harmful area effect, you only take the consequence once: the effect targets you as a unified character, and may choose either of your bodies to determine whether you are an eligible target. Note however that if one twin is cut, the other twin manifests the same cut, and if one twin’s broken arm is set, so is the other twin’s.
The final principle is that this simultenaity only applies to the twins’ bodies and minds. Therefore, a Gemini only benefits from armor present on the body targetted, has to own two pairs of clothes to not be nude, has to own two pairs of sunglasses to go to the beach, can’t teleport potions between theirself, can’t use a weapon that is not wielded locally, and so on. Make sure to carefully denote which twin has what, and which twin is which. By default, if forgotten, the least favorable interpretation is applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Gemini, do you consider yourself to be a single person in two places? Are you instead two similar yet nonetheless distinct personalities? Perhaps you are a multiple-personality disorder made physically manifest? Gemini often have strange mannerisms: finishing sentences for each other, only one ever speaking, wearing identical clothing, always having the exact same (or opposite!) emotion… be creative! Consider whether or not you can keep secrets from your alter-self, whether you have the same dreams at night, and how you feel when someone pays more attention to your alter-self than you. Play a Gemini if you are interested in roleplaying multiple characters, like doing clever things with your shared consciousness, and unnerving the locals.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Setting - Introductory Overview</title>
   <link href="http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/nendsame%20rpg/2012/09/13/Setting-%20Introductory%20Overview"/>
   <updated>2012-09-13T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/nendsame%20rpg/2012/09/13/Setting- Introductory Overview</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The great city of Jezevel is an enormous vision of bone and gypsum, a sprawling, towering landscape of termite mound skyscrapers and alleyway warrens. Burying a peninsula the size of Denmark, stopped only by the the icy wastes to the north and the arctic ocean on all other sides, Jezevel is a surreal ruin on the face of a barren, snow-covered planet. The logic of the city is chaotic, like some architect’s bizarre nightmare: white bridges crisscrossing each other, avenues terminating in dead-ends nonetheless girded along their length by impressive archways, mazeways giving way to plazas overlooked by the vertiginous height of the city spires. The walls are smooth like bone, the ground a fine alabaster, and the only thing stranger than its form is that the city is almost entirely empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no evidence of a cataclysm, and it could well be that the intended inhabitants never arrived: perhaps the city simply grew out of the ground on an impulse. Nonetheless, there are a few denizens. Near the waterways and particularly near the shore are the Sakire, a race of people who did not build this city, but do call it home. The landscape is absent of anything but the most meagre parcel of arable land, usually in the form of some embryonic park planted in the midst of the city, and as a result the Sakire make their living off of fishing and whaling out on the cold ocean. The Sakire wear the furs of seals, burn whale fat candles where the ancient city fixtures do not provide light, and wander around the ancient city when they feel more adventurous. It is about these Sakire who poke into the dangerous interior of the city that this setting is primarily about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jezevel, as one leaves the lower places by the shores, rapidly rises up in a set of alabaster terraces. These terraces in turn are riddled with skybridges and half-formed apartment complexes and cathedral-like structures. As these edifices pile upon each other, they rise into spires and ridges that dominate the landscape. This landscape is not, however, a museum to meander through: it is riddled with Sakire outcasts and (more threateningly) the mysterious Golems. These constructs, made more of stone than flesh, wander the corridors of the interior on seemingly random errands: mending a wall, righting an antenna mast, or demolishing a building with their fists. A bestiary of golem types can fall upon the feckless adventurer, with nearly all of them united in a conspiracy to repel Sakire who would intrude. Although old remnant technologies and secrets remain for the taking, few survive the attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jezevel is a remnant itself of an advanced and wholly forgotten race of forebears, and only primitives and forsaken robotic golems remain as witnesses to its existence. Regardless of the originating forces of this place, for the Sakire it is simply a home, a milieu within which their personal dramas and histories can unfold, and a looming artifact to be explored.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Summary of Adventures Unwritten!</title>
   <link href="http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/oldblog/2012/01/25/summary-of-adventures-unwritten"/>
   <updated>2012-01-25T04:26:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/oldblog/2012/01/25/summary-of-adventures-unwritten</id>
   <content type="html">Hey there! I have kept on playing, but with an emphasis on coming up with a bit of a plot for Our Heroes to follow, and it doesn&#39;t seem to do justice to that for me to do combat summaries. However, lately I&#39;ve been a bit too busy to play the games *AND* do full nice write-ups, so will not likely be able to post what I&#39;d like to, quality wise. So, I&#39;ll write summaries at each level for now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Level 9: Thieves in the Night&lt;br /&gt;Our heroes are relaxing at Mia&#39;s alchemical apothecary when a whole den of thieves storms in upstairs and through the front door. Two thief brutes with a vicious mastiff attack our heroes while they are sipping on tea, while 5 thieves upstairs root through Mia&#39;s stock looking for something! Our heroes are pinned against the wall and send the brutes and their dogs packing and rush upstairs as quick as possible. Three thieves jump out the window with a stolen vial of Deathbloom Serum Mia had hidden, and two thief warriors fight a delaying action. After killing the warriors, Our Heroes dash into the night, towards the docks, in pursuit of the burglars. Losing track of them for a moment, they stumble upon them and see them duck into a hideout by a pier: a storehouse for seal clubbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mia and Saribke knock down the front door and toss firebombs at the thieves, fighting off a thief mage and two chainfighters, and end up having to fight an Oni in the basement who has the deathly serum. After a difficult fight with the Oni, the Oni manages to escape. However, after searching the place and deciphering a coded diary, the heroes are able to uncover a plot to murder the local Prefect at a dinner party the next day. Our heroes go to sleep at a local inn, but they are ambushed at night by two doppleganger assassins. Fighting unarmored, it is a close fight but they manage to kill the shapeshifters before coming to a fatal end. They try to sleep until morning, where they will have to figure a way to warn the prefect.</content>

   <title>Swapping Up A Bit</title>

   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/oldblog/2012/01/15/swapping-up-bit</id>
   <content type="html">Decided to use the new books I&#39;ve ordered (Eberron Campaign/Player Guides and Arcane Power): gonna rebuild Mia as an artificer, since I really like some of the abilities and I&#39;ve enjoyed having her throw alchemical bombs all around the place more than cursing people. I&#39;ll also take the opportunity to rebuild Saribke a bit: same basic idea, but gonna have him try out a Bastard Sword and a Heavy Shield for a while, and choose some different powers for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main changes:&lt;br /&gt;-Saribke and Mia will both be Mul&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;-Mia uses a throwing dagger instead of a pact blade, and is an artificer with weapon buff abilities and heavy use of alchemical items. She can help saribke out a lot more now, and can heal.&lt;br /&gt;-Saribke switches to bastard sword and heavy shield, and is more &#39;physical&#39; stat wise, so he can take some nice feats later in his career.&lt;br /&gt;-Both are much more survivable: more HP, more surges, and more capability for resisting/healing themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main things staying the same:&lt;br /&gt;-Mia tries to stay behind Saribke and spams ranged attacks and grenades.&lt;br /&gt;-Saribke is very mobile, tough, and does lots of push attacks.</content>

   <title>Delve 6: Silly Snakes, Life is for People!</title>
   <link href="http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/oldblog/2012/01/13/delve-6-silly-snakes-life-is-for-people"/>
   <updated>2012-01-13T11:48:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/oldblog/2012/01/13/delve-6-silly-snakes-life-is-for-people</id>
   <content type="html">Our Heroes, afraid that success had made them forget their roots and where they came from, return to basics and assault a Pit of Cultish Despair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encounter 16: Herein, Our Heroes Yawn at Yuan-Ti&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barging down the stairs, Saribke and Mia are startled to discover a snake pit that has the temerity to challenge their manifest ownership of anything beneath street level! Using grenades of alchemical fire, Mia makes kebab sans stick of half the enemy, while Saribke inserts the the skewer into those who remain. After a quick overwhelming assault, Our Heroes emerge victorious, and push deeper into the dungoen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: Two-turn kill. Lots and lots of minions get blown to smithereens by blast damage, and making Mia take Alchemy is really paying off. No loot, but very little damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encounter 17: Coils and Coils of Fun&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next chamber reveals four enormous snakes coiled around pillars in a dank, moss-ridden hall. Recognizing immediately that half of them are constrictors and the other two are vipers, Saribke does the arithmatic and discerns that this could be very, very bad for Our Heroes, and ushers Mia toward a corner and readies attack actions to defend against snakes coming up and encircling them like the belts they aren&#39;t. When the snakes uncoil and... leap?... into combat, what ensues is a brutal fight where Saribke spends half the time being crushed to death while Mia throws explosions near (although sometimes at) Saribke and his serpentine captor. In the end however, Our Heroes succeed in defeating the glorified shoelaces, although Saribke came out perhaps a foot taller and a bit skinnier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: Standard fight, 8 healing surges used total. Mia and Saribke root about the room and find 2 rubies. Our heroes push into the final chamber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encounter 18: Actually Being a Reptile Is Better Than Just Looking Like One&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next room is a large hall with a sunken, watery floor, and Yuan-Ti cavort happily in the shallows, with a hierophant doing something humbly and peacefully at an altar. Butterflies and motes of light dance in columns of soft warm light, and a harp might be heard playing. Tired of these evil shenanigans, Mia lobs fiery Graecian death on these vermin, and Saribke forcibly introduces the others to the business end of a hostile spearhead takeover. The hierophant, horrified at seeing his brethren murdered, makes a quite moving speech of indictment against his assailants and their violent, intolerant ways. Thankfully for the psyche of Our Heroes, it came out as &quot;sssszzzsszszszsSSZsZszszs&quot;, and the hierophant fell dead face down into the muck, but not before finishing a last invocation...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the shadowy dark corners of the room, a crocodile the size of a bus emerges to avenge the death of the snake that lovingly raised it from a tadpole... or something. It is unknown to this day whose eyes grew wider at that moment, Mia&#39;s or Saribke&#39;s, for no calipers were on hand, but the result was clear: a long encounter where Saribke and Mia ran like wimps all around the room taking potshots at the crocodile until it relented and escaped out into the swamp after a half hour of eating chunks of Our Heroes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: Based on the encounter description, I would have expected the Yuan-Ti to be the bulk of the time, but they went down in three relatively easy rounds. Instead, the Crocodile was a ridiculous beast. Saribke, fleeing the whole time, still managed to be halfway inside the crocodile&#39;s mouth half of the time: the crocodile&#39;s armor was so thick that Saribke got clobbered and salivated on whenever he tried to pierce it, so Mia basically played at ranged demolition for no less than 12 turns before the croc peaced out. Both come out ragged and torn, but they level up and loot the Yuan-Ti Orphanage Charity Fund for a solid 3000gp.</content>

   <content type="html">Our Heroes do something imaginative and new: they attack a dungeon of Evil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encounter 13: I Really Really Really Hate Wights&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saribke and Mia stroll into the tombs, only to be beset by a trio of skeleton archers and two wights. The battle is very short, but the wights manage to steal 4 healing surges from Mia before being slain, and Saribke only manages to kill the archers in time to save Mia from dying. Mia heals up and uses up all her remaining healing. Great...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: Easy win, but Mia got unlucky and targetted. She has to go the rest of the encounter with no healing whatsoever...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encounter 14: Zombies Hit Haaaaard&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saribke leads ahead of Mia by 30 feet and runs into a set of zombies and blazing skeleton archers. Tanking all the damage, Saribke gets pummelled by the zombie slams, and Our Heroes destroy the enemy only after much chicanery with kiting tactics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: Punishing, but a victory. Hiding Mia from fire was hard, and Saribke really took a beating from several lucky zombie hits. So far, the encounter is going very quickly but very difficultly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encounter 15: Obligatory Necromancer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the deepest part of the tomb, Our Heroes find a hulking zombie commanded by an evil necromancer. Saribke and Mia quickly kill the zombie, but it rises again thanks to the necromancer. Going to Plan B, Saribke and Mia run all around the room harassing the necromancer, but the zombie manages to corner Mia and kill her outright: not unconscious, but cold dead. Enraged, Saribke does some exceptional positioning and usage of techniques to kill the necromancer, and shortly overcomes the hulking zombie. After snatching 1000gp from the necromancer and a pair of Rings of Brotherhood (a healing item), Saribke carries Mia out of the tomb, and pays for a Raise Dead ritual to be performed on her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: Saribke and Mia use all their action points to good effect, but Mia is simply too hurt from having no healing this Delve to survive a strong attack from the zombie hulk. The necromancer was annoying and almost ended the party. This delve only barely paid for itself, and the only good thing that happened was that the duo levelled up. My least favorite delve so far: healing surge removal is a death sentence for my team!</content>

   <title>Delve 4: Gnoll Big Deal</title>

   <content type="html">Our Heroes are assigned to clear out another cult location, in the spirit of religious intolerance. Death to the Gnoll Cult of Azkabam!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encounter 10: Slippery Slope&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saribke and Mia are wandering in the cold underground catacombs of St. Coro&#39;s church when they stumble upon a thin chasm blocking entry to a large room, where gnolls stand ready to defend their hideout. Leaping over the chasm, Our Heroes charge into battle, and are able to catch the gnolls off guard with their incredible speed. The gnolls trigger a mechanical trap, causing the room to begin to fill with fast moving drifts of snow, in the vain hope of slowing Our Heroes down. The three gnoll guards are promptly wiped out, and Our Heroes rush up the stairs into the body of the hideout!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: Straightforward victory. The trap would have been formidable and perhaps tossed Mia and Saribke into the chasm, but between Saribke&#39;s teleporting initial attack and Mia&#39;s ability to teleport whenever a marked foe fell, the two handily stayed near the gnolls the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encounter 11: Scuffle Hustle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bursting into the main hangout area of the hideout, Our Heroes are greeted by four hyenas, two gnoll warriors, and a gnoll sniper. Saribke and Mia get the first strike in, and focus on the stronger gnolls. When the gnoll sniper takes a shot at Saribke, Saribke teleports all the way across the room and gets to grips trying to stop the sniper&#39;s exceptional marksmanship. Mia, left alone on the other side of the room, switches to killing hyenas in order to gain an immediate teleport and concealment bonus, making her way away from the threat of two gnoll warriors and their dogs towards Saribke. The sniper dead and Our Heroes reunited, the two make a stand in the corner of the room and narrowly fend off the gnoll warriors. After a bloody melee, the room is quiet, with only the sound of a cackling laugh from the room beyond. Our Heroes see a statue of a tentacled monstrosity, and Mia notices a compartment in it. In it is discovered a tidy sum of gold and a blob of what appears to be shiny spiderweb. Withdrawing the blob, it explodes, covering and merging with her clothes and starts shining very brightly: a Scintillating enchantment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: Difficult bloody win. Our heroes get 600 gold and Mia gets a Scintillating +2 enchantment for her clothes. I suppose that&#39;s a good kind of enchantment for women&#39;s apparel to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encounter 12: Echoes of R&#39;lyeh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making their way into the next chamber, Our Heroes encounter a tall Gnoll with a skull mask, flanked by 3 of his elite archers, with a yawning hole in the middle of the room. Growling some fierce sounding retort, the Gnoll Master raises a halberd againts Saribke and the two begin a duel as the Archers and Mia shoot at each other. Taking care to avoid the pit in the center, Mia and Saribke engage in a disciplined defense, picking apart the Gnoll Master and scattering the archers over the course of a minute. The Gnoll Master goes down after a fierce polearm duel with Saribke, and only one archer remains standing beneath the onslaught of Mia&#39;s powers. The last archer is slain, and the room begins to shake and rumble: a black tentacled mass floats out of the pit! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slow, levitating mass catches Saribke off guard, grabs him, electrocutes him, and throws the nearly-dead body into the pit! A horrified Mia foregoes assailing the abyssal monster, hooks a grappling hook onto the end of her coil of rope, sprints towards the monster, and flings herself into the pit, the grappling hook holding fast against the rim of the hole as she quickly repels down to the dark chamber below. Saribke, clinging to life, is revived via Mia&#39;s frantic attempts to aid him, just in time for the hulking monstrosity to float down into the chamber, lit only by Mia&#39;s glowing garb. What followed was a highly-disciplined mobile defense, where dashing in and out of the entity&#39;s grasp eventually gave Our Heroes a hard-won victory, both near death when the shadowy blob of tentacles seized up and collapsed in a pile of dark goo. The gnolls&#39; god was slain! Our duo collapse in exhaustion, but soon poke around the lair for treasure: none is found. The two climb up Mia&#39;s rope and leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: Very close call. Saribke was nearly killed outright between the three attacks and the fall damage, but Mia managed to pull him through with a lucky Heal roll. Once in the larger room beneath the well, they were able to maneuver enough to survive the Level 9 Elite. The light from the Scintillating clothes she had just received was actually very useful in the pitchblack room!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The duo are a formidable force, and are indeed roughly equivalent to a 4-person party due to their damage output. However, the fact that they have half the hit points means that any one of them going unconscious is a crisis occurance. Should they fall to a swarm rather than a large solo creature, it is hard to see how they can reliably survive, particularly if Saribke&#39;s crowd control is lost. Mia has a useful &#39;escape&#39; ability (teleport 3 and gain concealment) when she&#39;s hurt, used heavily in Encounter 11, means she&#39;s usually less likely to die than Saribke, who is a damage magnet. I think I will have Mia use her next few level ups to help the duo&#39;s survivability, and Saribke will try to put out more damage.</content>

   <title>Delve 3: Storming the Cult of Gessank</title>

   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/oldblog/2012/01/07/delve-3-storming-cult-of-gessank</id>
   <content type="html">A dark evil is brewing in the middle of the city of Savista, and Our Heroes have been contracted by the Clanmaster Savista to clear out a suspected den of abhuman brutes in the slums. Confident, Mia and Saribke go to the large abandoned granary building to do Massive Yet Sanctioned Harm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encounter 7: Really Just Kind of Unfair&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saribke and Mia burst through the door and encounter two fire beetles and three ork berserkers, the area being lit up solely by the beetles&#39; ambient light. The fire beetles are made to abruptly give up the ghost, plunging the room back into darkness. Doing their best, the orks charge Our Heroes, but are forced to swing wildly in the dark, and the only blow that could have hit missed Saribke by a wide margin. Mia breaks a sunrod, lighting up the place, and the duo dispatch an ork. Then, stuffing the sunrod back into her leather satchel, plunges the room back into utter darkness. Our heroes then cunningly move about in the dark. The orks, unable to find their torches, are one by one eliminated via this tactic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: Utter victory. Saribke harries the orks enough to keep them from reaching a door to let in moonlight, and so he and Mia emerge unharmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encounter 8: Rude Dinner Guests&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deeper in the complex, Saribke and Mia encounter a dining room full of Orks enjoying an innocent repast. What ensues is a surprisingly straightforward tactical scenario where Saribke repeatedly throws the entire dinner party back while Mia pings bursts of eldritch power and alchemical fire at them. The fire is particularly effective, toasting several of the more flammable guests. Our Heroes get some light wounds from the sheer number of reeling orks, but emerge quickly victorious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: Straightforward victory, with no particularly crazy events. Saribke plays his standard bodyguard role and keeps the horde of minions from ganging up too much on him and Mia. Mia uses a batch of Alchemist&#39;s Fire she whipped up to great effect, resulting in only a bloodied status for our Duo. 4 healing surges expended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encounter 9: Comeuppance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going away from the dining hall, Our Heroes walk into the barracks, where two ork berserkers, a dire wolf, and a Hulking Athletic Ork Chieftain +1 lie in wait, and Our Heroes are caught off guard. Surviving a merciless onslaught, Saribke and Mia finally are able to muster a response, although both are bloodied. In a frenzy of activity (4 bonus actions used, with all dailies expended!), the assailants are buffeted across the room and the Ork Chieftain is bloodied and thrown prone (Saribke), with a host of ugly curses placed on him by Mia. Another furious round of action later, and the Chieftain is laid low inciting a bit of hope for Our Heroes, but the berserkers and the wolf are fierce opponents and manage to separate Mia and knock her to the gates of Death. Killing the wolf, Saribke rushes to her side and fends off the two berserkers while Mia musters the will to survive. In a tense two rounds, Saribke manages to kill one of the berserkers, but Mia slips closer and closer to death. Finally killing the last Ork, Saribke administers to Mia&#39;s wounds, and she stabilizes. With a sigh of relief, Our Heroes survive and level up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: Incredibly difficult, by-the-skin-of-my-teeth victory. Making up for the ease of the first two encounters, the final room had few defensible locations, and enough obstacles to impede our mobile heroes. The Chieftain was a level 8 Elite Brute, and did so much harm that when he finally died, the remaining opponents had enough advantage on Mia and Saribke to be formidable threats. Mia almost failed all her saves against death, which would have ended my little Solitaire D&amp;D experiment for now. Thankfully, our heroes attain Level 4, a pretty awesome level!

   <title>Delve 2: Against Petty Lords</title>
   <link href="http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/oldblog/2012/01/06/delve-2-against-petty-lords"/>

   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/oldblog/2012/01/06/delve-2-against-petty-lords</id>
   <content type="html">Heading into a village, our heroes find that a band of goblins have placed themselves as local rulers, living fat off tributes from the local gnomes. In return for access to the local gnome artificier&#39;s stock of minor magic goods, Saribke and Mia agree to carry out a frontal assault on the goblin&#39;s tower. Brazenly, they knock down the front door!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encounter 4: Broken Card Game&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therein, no less than a dozen goblins and a big hobgoblin are engaged in various card and gambling games. Tables are quickly overturned and daggers withdrawn, and all parties get involved in a brawl near the door, with Saribke keeping as many as possible at bay while Mia plunks the Hobgoblin. The goblins go down pretty quickly, but the hobgoblin is a big brute that doesn&#39;t go down until all the furniture is broken to splinters: Mia and Saribke confuzzle him with attacks of opportunity and flanking until he falls to the ground dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: Heroes win pretty decisively, although Mia and Saribke get a bit wounded. Saribke 8 HP, Mia 13 HP. 7 Healing surges used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encounter 5: Up the Spiral Staircase&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting up the inside of the hollow round tower, our heroes find themselves underattack from above, forcing them to charge up the stairs several floors to reach their first set of skeletal assailants. Saribke dispatches them quickly, and Mia fruitlessly flings blasts at the snipers above. Pressing the charge, Saribke makes an incredible leap across the tower, pulling himself up with his arms to quickly dispatch one of the dismayed snipers. Mia rushes up the stairs and kills a second, but not before Saribke has vaulted further to take out another. Another decisive rush, and all the snipers are dealt with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: Straightforward victory. Saribke suffered the brunt of the shots, but never hit Bloodied status. Saribke 26 HP, Mia full HP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encounter 6: The Goblin Boss and Bodyguard&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scrambling to the summit of the tower, Saribke and Mia come out into a room with a broad open balcony, the railing crumbled away. Opposite the balcony, a Goblin Boss, his bodyguards, and two dire wolves snarl and, confident in their strength, hurl headlong towards our heroes. Mia and Saribke a bit surprised, they edge towards the open ledge and get attacked first by the wolves as the goblins ready their weapons and charge. However, in possibly the most amazing combo I&#39;ve ever pulled off in a roleplaying game, Saribke swaps location with the goblin boss, and uses his concussive defense to hurl all but one of the wolves off the top of the tower in an epic sweep of a glaive. Falling to their deaths, the boss and his coterie are dispatched before they can even get strikes in! The remaining wolf is easily crushed by Mia&#39;s eldritch blasts, and the tower is cleared!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: Dominating victory. Saribke took a total of 9 damage, and killed 4 full-featured monsters in a single hit. The boss&#39;s treasure contained 410 gold, a hearty sum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helped incredibly by terrain and the ability to funnel enemies effectively, this delve went particularly well, the main challenge being the hobgoblin on the first floor. The summit of the tower was a hilarious occurance, mostly caused by Mia luring the last group away from perhaps more sound locations. Getting lucky, Mia wasn&#39;t hurt by the wolves, and Saribke was perfectly placed to knock the entire encounter out the window. Defenestration! The local gnome artificier gifted a Lifedrinker Glaive +1 to Saribke, and Mia was able to get a Pact Blade +1, so she should be a bit more accurate now. Along with a couple healing potions, this turned out to be a fruitful outing. I am concerned about our heroes&#39; ability to deal with multiple, hard-hitting monsters though: reliance on a single healing surge within each encounter might end up being insufficient from keeping Saribke alive, and once he falls Mia is likely to be quickly killed without his deflective defense. I will throw in a small Skill Challenge before the next Delve for a few more experience points for the two: they are shy of 3rd level by a mere 50 points.</content>

   <title>Delve 1: Fighting Brigands</title>

   <content type="html">Saribke: Human Battlemind, using glaive and speed to toss enemies tumbling back.&lt;br /&gt;Mia: Half-Elf Warlock, blasting enemies from a range with eldritch power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;First Encounter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our heroes are travelling along in the desert when ambushed by a cadre of kobold slingers atop a rock outcropping. In a devastating stroke, they all hammer Saribke with sling stones, bloodying him immediately. Mia reacts by blasting two of the kobolds apart with a blast, while Saribke stirs into action, charging up the outcropping in time to hobble an assailant while forcing four other kobolds to escape Saribke&#39;s arcing glaive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three of the taller kobolds hurl magical slingstones against Saribke in panic to the charge, although their aim faltered. The remaining kobolds jumped into melee against him, doing significant damage. Mia runs closer, hurling blasts into the froth. Saribke, near death and furiously dismembering his assailants, jumps off the rock outcropping to Mia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking their cue, the kobolds turn attention to Mia, to disastrous effect. In response, she blasts two of the taller kobolds, and Saribke charges back in a daring effort to turn the tide. Luck on our hero&#39;s side, the kobolds are reduced to one tall kobold, which is promptly finished off by a blast from Mia. Our heroes catch their breath and heal up a bit (4 healing surges each!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: Heroes barely win. Saribke with 2 HP, Mia with 4. 13/21 healing surges left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Second Encounter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Descending into a cave entrance found in the rock outcropping, our heroes find themselves entering a small, dark ruin. Using a sunrod from Mia&#39;s bag, a group of well equipped kobolds are revealed! Saribke leaps into action, with Mia targetting a shaman-garbed kobold further within the ruined hall. The battle is pitched but quick, with Saribke using the glaive to disperse the kobolds to gain attacks of opportunity. Mia and the shaman kobold get into a ranged spellcasting duel, with Mia using a fey blind spell to win the challenge. The battle is incredibly pitched, with the well armored kobolds using flanking attacks and the shaman using blast spells. Our heroes heal up a bit (another 8 surges used).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: Heroes scrape a win. Saribke with 5 HP, Mia with 10. 7/21 healing surges left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Third Encounter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carefully inching down into the deepest part of the ruin, our heroes run into an audience room where a young white dragon holds court over 10 kobold supplicants. Forewarned by the sounds of earlier battle, the kobolds move quickly to attack. However, Saribke is quick and dives into the fray, cutting down 3 before the kobolds pile on in a huge cluster of melee. Mia blinds one kobold that snuck behind Saribke, saving her ally&#39;s life: the kobolds do huge amounts of damage to lightly-armored Saribke, and any extra flanking surely would have been the end, since the young white dragon promptly breaths icy jets of cold into the melee, knocking Saribke to 5 HP and destroying 3 of its own kobolds. Reacting swiftly to the development, Mia lands an incredible critical hit, taking the Dragon from fresh to bloodied in a single massive stroke (32 damage!). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saribke deals with 2 more kobolds, and trips the dragon. The remaining 2 kobolds keep striking at Saribke, hurting him more. The dragon launches into an enraged fury, biting and clawing at Saribke, but in its haste only lands glancing scratches. Mia responds by finishing off the dragon with another great set of hits. Saribke quickly finishes off the remainding kobolds, and the halls go quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: Heroes win! Saribke has 6 HP, and Mia is unharmed. 200 gold is found, as well as a suit of Mithral Scale Armor +1 (for Saribke... 13 AC was waaaaay too low: 20 AC much better!). Both level up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly effective duo, considering that they were only level 1 and didn&#39;t take an extended rest. The first two encounters Mia was consistently a great ranged blaster, dealing well with the stronger enemies in each encounter. However, this focus on the stronger enemies left Saribke alone to deal with the hordes of minions and fighters. With only 13 AC, there was essentially a whole set of freebie shots from minions, building up into huge amounts of damage: Saribke had 40HP, but regularly took 20~ damage after the first enemy turn. Thankfully, Saribke could reliably dish out multiple hits each round, and used a special attack heavily, shoving enemies 4 squares away. Both heroes performed quite well considering, and the Mithral Scale armor bodes well for their chances in the future. The extra cash will likely go towards buying Mia an implement to improve her attacks.</content>

   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/oldblog/2012/01/04/running-solitaire-d</id>
   <content type="html">I&#39;ve decided I&#39;d like to actually use the various 4e Dungeons &amp; Dragons books I brought back out to Boston with me by playing a few solitaire games. The plan is to run as many of the small adventures in the Dungeon Delves book until I die. The book has tactics and monster stats handy for each encounter, so should be easier to run for myself than randomly generating a dungeon myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An interesting bit is that I&#39;m too lazy to run umpteen monsters at the same time as a full party of adventurers. So, instead of running 4 player characters, I will be running 2! I&#39;m also too lazy to tweak the encounters every time to account for my tiny party: instead, I&#39;m giving my adventurers two initiatives: this will let them do their thing twice each round. No extra hit points, no extra action points, and half the variety of accessible powers will still make this quite a challenge :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night, I ran two of three encounters in the first level delve: I&#39;ll write up the delve when I finish the third boss encounter. So far, it has been narrow victories with clinging-to-life-ed-ness.</content>

   <content type="html">Have been adding different shades of gray for the past week on assault squad Chordeiles. Generally pleased with them so far, although they have a looong way to go before being finished. I also worked on their jetpacks, but they aren&#39;t shown here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combat Squad Nighthawk and Combat Squad Poorwill&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UEsctYC-mm8/Tl5CRqmFVwI/AAAAAAAAAFw/b1c5PrRTFTk/s1600/Squad%2BChordeiles%2Band%2BPoorwill.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UEsctYC-mm8/Tl5CRqmFVwI/AAAAAAAAAFw/b1c5PrRTFTk/s320/Squad%2BChordeiles%2Band%2BPoorwill.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combat Squad Nighthawk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pDi45Jb5Y3s/Tl5CR6g-aDI/AAAAAAAAAF4/DijyN369Gd4/s1600/Squad%2BChordeiles.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pDi45Jb5Y3s/Tl5CR6g-aDI/AAAAAAAAAF4/DijyN369Gd4/s320/Squad%2BChordeiles.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content>

   <title>Highlights: Highlights</title>

   <content type="html">Testing out highlighting on my assault marines... being super cautious, since I have some model-fear. Mixed Gray &amp; Black 1:1 and got a very subtle shine on the model&#39;s exposed surfaces, leaving crannies black. Any tips on highlighting? Right now just planning on going 1:1 to 2:1 to 3:1 with more limited application each go, then applying a black wash, then a gray re-highlight.</content>

   <content type="html">My GW order arrived today:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-2 Assault Squad boxes&lt;br /&gt;-Codex: SM book&lt;br /&gt;-2 brushes&lt;br /&gt;-6 paints&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still waiting on my Forge World sprues, which should arrive either tomorrow or early next week.&lt;br /&gt;-2 Raven Guard upgrade sprues&lt;br /&gt;-1 Captain Korvydae&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Idea is to make a very special assault squad to accompany Korvydae: his rules (if my opponent allows Forge World rules) lets me take assault squads as Troops units as long as I bring along a scout unit too... in all other senses he is just a jumppack Captain. The big thing there is that it&#39;ll let my assault squads not only contest objectives, but claim them too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m hashing out a tentative Army List plan tonight: goal is to have a very mobile, fluffy force emphasizing mobility and precision deep striking that can play well from 500 to 2000 points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forge World sprues arrived too... the detail is incredible on them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also grabbed cutters and a file from the hardware store... will be fun to get started in on these models!</content>

   <title>First Combat Squad</title>
   <link href="http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/oldblog/2011/08/05/first-combat-squad"/>
   <updated>2011-08-05T21:43:00+08:00</updated>
   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/oldblog/2011/08/05/first-combat-squad</id>
   <content type="html">My box of stuff from Games Workshop showed up! I had ordered online their starter painting set, some super glue, and a can of black spraypaint. The starter set comes with a small oddball collection of paints (no green!), a cheap-ish brush, and 5 snap-together bolter-equipped soldiers. Because I&#39;m weighing the pros and cons of entering the hobby of painting lots of little guys, this set of materials is a kind of &#39;test run&#39; to see if I enjoy painting them enough to do so regularly. It&#39;s a bit of a costly test tho: I&#39;ve gone out and gotten a small painting table and a stool too, so I got to work right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I took them outside and spray painted them black. I used a cardboard box, placing the sprue on its side leaned up against the interior. We have an empty parking space, so I just did it there. Quick short bursts on both sides until the sprue was covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the sprue&#39;d dried, I brought the sprue inside and took the marine bodies and shoulder pads off the sprue. I touched up the removed models with black where the sprue had connected them, and attached the bodies to their bases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fN0niaOhNfQ/Tjvto32l5eI/AAAAAAAAAFE/EjGu2K-MzOQ/s1600/1%2B-%2BSpraypainted.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;241&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fN0niaOhNfQ/Tjvto32l5eI/AAAAAAAAAFE/EjGu2K-MzOQ/s320/1%2B-%2BSpraypainted.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The snap-together aspect of these models is really dumb: the pegs don&#39;t really fit right, and the joins between parts are quite loose. Thankfully, the &#39;non-starter&#39; models are much more poseable and professional looking. For these models I&#39;m sawing off the snap-pegs and just using super glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After they dried, I confirmed that I really just wanted to practice technique on these marines. They are supposed to be painted blue, but Dad already has an impressively painted collection of these smurfs; since I&#39;m likely going with a darker-colored army anyways, I&#39;ll paint these marines dark with white shoulderpads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I had a small Blood Angels army way back when, and I remember how hard it was to paint white on black: it&#39;s always an uneven, brush-strokey, blobby mess. So I resolved to do something fancy for my first painting bit: paint the shoulder pad white. I mix 2 drops of white and black 1:1 to get a dark gray, and add 3 drops of water from my drinking cup to make it a bit more liquidy. After applying it to the shoulder pad and chest emblazonment, I added another drop of white to the mix, and gave the shoulder pad another thin coat. Repeating, it took several thin layers to build up a semi-respectable light-gray foundation. Only then did I use the white alone (2:1 paint/water) and finish the white shoulderpad. I then did a bit of half-hearted highlighting with my leftover light gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-c2-pw9DSQ0E/TjvtpGLaMRI/AAAAAAAAAFM/8tEiczcLK04/s1600/2%2B-%2BAquila%2Band%2BWhite%2Bshoulder.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-c2-pw9DSQ0E/TjvtpGLaMRI/AAAAAAAAAFM/8tEiczcLK04/s320/2%2B-%2BAquila%2Band%2BWhite%2Bshoulder.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This had taken a while, seeing how I had done 5 shoulderpads with 5 thin coats each, so I wanted to practice brush control a bit. Towards this end, I painted the omega symbol on the right shoulder pad white against its black background, and trimmed both pads with a gold metallic paint. It took lots of fine motor skill I&#39;ve not used in a long time, but I got it done with minimal touch-up work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A brief complaint: the black shoulderpad, for some unknown reason, has to be snapped onto the model. The peg is completely wrong: I had to saw it off on each model just to get the shoulder snug to the model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dSezGvnaPWE/Tjvtpb4VH0I/AAAAAAAAAFU/X5DDWTTLPuw/s1600/4%2B-%2BA%2Bbit%2Bof%2Bgold.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dSezGvnaPWE/Tjvtpb4VH0I/AAAAAAAAAFU/X5DDWTTLPuw/s320/4%2B-%2BA%2Bbit%2Bof%2Bgold.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this, I mostly dinked around trying to highlight a few things on the model by coloring them. Here&#39;s the back after my efforts (eyes are a *pain*!):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wKvAzP9BSB8/TjvtpubD2UI/AAAAAAAAAFc/wY-pJLSbxrg/s1600/5%2B-%2BThe%2BBack.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wKvAzP9BSB8/TjvtpubD2UI/AAAAAAAAAFc/wY-pJLSbxrg/s320/5%2B-%2BThe%2BBack.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here&#39;s the front:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8neHiJlmXM8/Tjvtp-xt6XI/AAAAAAAAAFk/VMHxxKtGj_Y/s1600/6%2B-%2BThe%2BFront.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8neHiJlmXM8/Tjvtp-xt6XI/AAAAAAAAAFk/VMHxxKtGj_Y/s320/6%2B-%2BThe%2BFront.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By this point, it&#39;d been a couple hours, and I needed to go to sleep. I&#39;ll revisit these (prolly with a wash on the shoulderpads and some highlighting) later.</content>

Definitely recommended for anyone looking for a vacation: no visa needed for the first 30 days, just need a passport, and it is a pretty epic little city.</content>

Today is my last day at work, and I look around me to see very few familiar places: the company has almost completely turned over, staff wise, during my stay. Only four people remain, and we can&#39;t really talk to each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite memories are:&lt;br /&gt;-Riding to the Sea with Chris&lt;br /&gt;-Chinese New Year&#39;s with Sean/Chris&lt;br /&gt;-Scooter riding with the guys&lt;br /&gt;-Counter-Strike\Starcraft\Ping-Pong with the guys&lt;br /&gt;-Hitting on girls at DADA&lt;br /&gt;-Goth Night&lt;br /&gt;-Rock Band with Michal&lt;br /&gt;-Being big-guy, design-wise&lt;br /&gt;-Hong Kong&lt;br /&gt;-Trying to keep up with Blake&#39;s walking pace when I was getting first situated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bitterest memories are:&lt;br /&gt;-The SoZ meltdown&lt;br /&gt;-All the artists quitting&lt;br /&gt;-Having my scooter stolen&lt;br /&gt;-The situations associated with Sean/Chris/Jeff/Blake leaving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, my &#39;vacation month&#39; here will be filled of many more positive memories. I am heading to Hong Kong to get a Tourist Visa, then will stay in Shanghai until the end of March, where I will then be hanging out in Seattle for a month or two. By that time, I will have spent 1 year and 50 days cumulative time within China&#39;s borders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Adventure indeed!</content>

Still deciding if I&#39;ll have a vacation with friends here in Shanghai for a month thereafter, or go straight back home on the first. I resigned largely over an honest evaluation of my relationship with the company, the fact that I am financially secure for the next year, and a desire to start a new chapter for myself personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What an exciting day!</content>

   <content type="html">Hey there, potpourri news time:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Being moved by the company to another apartment. Should be a grand distance of two blocks away. Hopefully this one has a heater.&lt;br /&gt;2. Got onto facebook, although I can&#39;t click on most of the buttons, nor log-in. I can only change my status (which I dislike doing) and replying to direct e-mails.&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#39;s really cold here, and I miss the sanity of the USA.</content>

   <content type="html">Happy New Year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lots of pictures from Beijing, but I am having difficulties with my thumbdrive, so they are still stuck on my laptop. Will keep trying to find a work-around. Beijing was awesome, although very very cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a related note, there is absolutely *NO ONE* at work today. I&#39;m the only person in. I somehow feel like I didn&#39;t get a memo, but last time I checked, Jan 3rd isn&#39;t a holiday...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christmas: 25th Dec&lt;br /&gt;New Year&#39;s Eve: 31st Dec&lt;br /&gt;New Year&#39;s Day: 1 Jan&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I&#39;m too drunk still&quot; Day: 3 Jan?</content>

   <content type="html">Last night, I went to a place across the street and ordered braised dog. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was really tasty! It had the texture of steak, although the flavor was much more like lamb. In the spicy hot pot, I dare say it has been one of the better meat dishes I&#39;ve had in China. We ordered it along with lamb, and we had difficulty telling which was which: we identified the dog by virtue of the hip-joint piece. The kind of dog used to eat is usually some kind of small yip-dog: likely a pomeranian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if there is dog bacon: then I could have some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug_iluxQ1IQ&amp;feature=related&quot;&gt;Beggin&#39; Strips&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s BACON!</content>

He&#39;ll be joining in on my D&amp;D game tonight with the other guys, but generally off doing whatever while I have work. So it&#39;s nice to have a friend from the states come visit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just working otherwise, although I&#39;ll probably have to sneak in some D&amp;D preparation at lunch today.</content>

   <content type="html">I am sick: yesterday I slept 24 hours in interrupted bursts. Half the reason I&#39;m in work today is because I cannot endure another day on my less-than-comfortable mattress. It will probably be a half-day regardless, and I have to make sure I don&#39;t spread it: gonna wash hands frequently, not touch public things (like door knobs) and ensure I don&#39;t talk into anyone&#39;s face. Feeling a bit better today, but I hope I&#39;m okay for the concert on Sunday.</content>

   <content type="html">Been hectic, but some fun stuff has happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m running a Dungeons &amp; Dragon game (4th edition), with all my western coworkers as players. I&#39;m running a Dark Suns game, which will mean a lot of blighted desert and insect monsters. My coworkers&#39; party consists of an elven Raider, a psionic Templar judge, and a sanctioned Defiler mage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the game features the dominance of the Sorceror Kings over their city in the campaign book, I&#39;m fast-forwarding to the future where the intrusion of The Gray (a scary nether-dimension) has resulted in an even more chaotic than normal setting where all the Sorceror Kings have either died or gone missing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The party is a troupe of templars who are in the service of the Sorceror King of Balic, a city on a peninsula into a quicksand sea. They are returning across the Great Ivory Plain from Gulg after a failed diplomatic effort: Gulg is in chaos, with its Sorceror Queen dead, nullifying their mission. Concerned that their own Sorceror King is gone too, they trek south across the great salt flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First for-real adventure is tonight!</content>

   <content type="html">Hong Kong was really awesome to visit, and I made sure to get around and see it for the day I was there. When I came to Shanghai, I was expecting crowded streets with dozens of big signs hanging over it, but got wide sidewalks and avenues: that&#39;s because my picture of China was Hong Kong basically. All the buildings are tall, there are hundreds of pawn shops, whole streets of fashion shops and boutiques, and thousands of money changers. There are British-style trams and taxis, bank towers left and right, and a full-blooded racial class system: Mandarin, Western, Indian, Cantonese, which makes for a really weird place. All the streets are named after western names: I stayed my night in an alley hotel off the intersection of Jordan and Nathan street (which apparantly have their own &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Road&quot;&gt;wikipedia article...&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hong Kong is in two parts: Kowloon and Honk Kong, with the former being on the &quot;inland island&quot;, and the latter being this pickle-shaped isle with a steep mountain range along the center. Hong Kong is centered on the strait formed by their proximity, which is called the &#39;Harbor&#39;. The skyscrapers are mostly on the isle, but the biggest skyscrapers are in Kowloon. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:HK_Kowloon_Panorama_2009.jpg&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is a recent picture: my hotel was nearish to the tallest skyscraper in the middle-right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hong Kong is tropical: it kept raining, then dry, then raining, then dry, the whole time I was there. I had to buy an umbrella from one of the 7-Elevens (which are EVERYWHERE). All the western chains were represented, and I&#39;d have to say the part of Hong Kong below the third floor is entirely dedicated to shops and public businesses. It&#39;s a great place to spend all your money away, I bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a sidenote... The Chinese Bureaucracy is truly Grand and Harmonious. I was really dreading my visit, imagining an even more incomprehensible DMV. The truth, though, is that getting my new visa took a total of an hour spread over two days (application, then pick up the next day). And it&#39;s not like I was the only one there that day: there were at least 100 people in front of me in line. However, the lady next to me in line was a television executive, and she answered some questions of mine about the extent of Chinese television regulation and censorship, and I think that caused my net approval of the bureaucratic efficiency to be counterbalanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yea: it is one of the only times I&#39;ve actually regretted forgetting my camera at home, and I think I&#39;d do a better job relating about my visit in person. It was indeed a very interesting visit, with lots of sights and sounds: I&#39;d be happy to go visit again for a longer duration. Shanghai is probably better to live in for my purposes, but Hong Kong is certainly more rewarding if you are wanting to visit somewhere Eastern but still have some home comforts.</content>

   <content type="html">Urghk... my visa is about to expire and apparantly I have to fly to Hong Kong and stay overnight Thursday-Friday while they handle it. I just hope I&#39;m back in time to see Chris off to Britain, and I&#39;m really not very enthusiastic about this abrupt itinerary, and vaguely pessimisstic about being able to figure out what I&#39;m supposed to do alone in Hong Kong dealing with a pseudo-Chinese bureaucracy of Doom.</content>

   <content type="html">Yeah: I&#39;d be coming back to the states for the whole of October (arrive late September, leave early November), and I think I&#39;ll visit Mom during that time for a few days, because I&#39;m pretty sure I can afford a domestic flight. I just need Mom to tell me the timing of Alek/Dalin&#39;s visit: I&#39;d love to bring my belated wedding pressie with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m pretty sure I owe obligatory pictures, so here are some from Huzhou:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A picture of me lately:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_aqVSzOK8dsA/TGJKYkjrPSI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/0dXUmR-AVrs/s1600/DSC01819.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 112px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_aqVSzOK8dsA/TGJKYkjrPSI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/0dXUmR-AVrs/s200/DSC01819.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5504043480590794018&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty bridge in Huzhou:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_aqVSzOK8dsA/TGJLsWi_fEI/AAAAAAAAAEY/NlP4dsLJLCs/s1600/DSC01830.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 150px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_aqVSzOK8dsA/TGJLsWi_fEI/AAAAAAAAAEY/NlP4dsLJLCs/s200/DSC01830.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5504044919938841666&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m on a muvvafuggin&#39; boat:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_aqVSzOK8dsA/TGJMkK5MldI/AAAAAAAAAEg/xjewb-UVDOg/s1600/DSC01847.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 150px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_aqVSzOK8dsA/TGJMkK5MldI/AAAAAAAAAEg/xjewb-UVDOg/s200/DSC01847.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5504045878883423698&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">Everything going alright here. Blake, the guy who brought me here from online, left the company after a period of inactivity, so I&#39;m a truly one-man design team &lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;de jure&lt;/span&gt; now. The company is eager to bring me back, so I&#39;ve told them I&#39;m willing to do another 6-month stint in return for the entirety of October off and a pay raise. It&#39;s a pretty sweet job here, where I get to do a variety of creative, math-y, and design tasks and get to work pretty independently. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s also kind of nice to be able to live comfortably *and* save real money at the same time, a winning combo. For example, assuming only a lackluster income for the game, my revenue share will easily pay my monthly college loan payments each month for several years. Free apartment is a huge boon too, and it&#39;s been a pretty good proposition so far. Those two together go a long way to eliminating the small amount of debt I have. I am able to tuck away ~$700 each month right now without having to skimp too much on my living: that&#39;s money saved for troubled times and future possibilities, and it&#39;s nice to have earned myself a cushion from scratch, building entirely on familial social support and my own hard work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is being so far from friends and family, and so I&#39;ve made clear to the company I&#39;ll not do another 9-month stint again: that&#39;s far too long to be back home. However, given the opportunity not only to finish this game, but to actually initiate a game of my own design and assemble the design team of my choice is something I&#39;ve always imagined I&#39;d like to do, and I&#39;m quite excited. Certainly more exciting than finding a US Census Bureau statistician position. I mean, I&#39;ve been making games since when I was little, so when I am given a budget, a whole art team and a bevy of programmers with the only constraint being that the game must be &#39;multiplayer&#39;, you can only imagine the possibilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What kind of game should I make? An MMORPG set in my imaginary world? Make a variant of Emperor of the Fading Suns where everything works? Some enormous game a la Animal Crossing? A game consisting purely of explosions? Who knows!</content>

   <content type="html">Interesting thing I realized the other day: I have a strong mental association between death and the taste of green apples. It&#39;s true: although I absolutely love the sour taste of a good Granny Smith, it has always had a note of forlorn-ness to it when I bite into one. It&#39;s not been debilitating to my apple-preferences, but I&#39;ve never been able to place exactly *why* until the other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I was chilling out in my room after work on my laptop and I accidentally knocked Tigris off the bed (yes, of course he&#39;s here! it&#39;s the year of the Tiger...) and so I picked him up. I was sipping on an apple juice, and I got hit by a memory from deep childhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember being at the house in Renton in the livingroom: the room was generally &#39;brown&#39; with wooden furniture and some paneling, and a kind of coffee-beige carpet. I think I was playing Megaman 5 trying to beat Gyroman, when Dad came out from the hallway (it led out of the livingroom and was the primary corridor where all the other rooms branched off, I think he was coming from the Library room, although I don&#39;t remember if the library door&#39;s handle was Pre- or Post-dad-escaping-to-rescue-me-from-a-bee-sting). I had just sat back down to play after pausing so I could get a green apple out from the kitchen, but I hadn&#39;t started to eat it when Dad said something along the lines of &#39;Hey Eddy, can I talk to you a minute?&#39;. Dad seemed sad, so I decided to let Tigris hold onto my apple so I could talk to Dad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dad asked me if I remembered his grandma, and I already figured that Bad News was imminent, so I said yes, even though I didn&#39;t really recall her right away: I was still a bit too young I think. Dad talked about her peanut butter cookies, and I *did* remember liking those, so I felt a bit more encouraged. Dad, with what I perceived as a flair for the melodramatic, then told me that she had passed away, and that there could be no more such cookies. It was a very sad moment, and I started to bawl: no more delicious unique great-grandma peanut-butter cookies! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He offered some words of consolation, but I mostly wanted to just stop crying, and so I recall soon returning back to the TV, giving a sad nod to Tigris as he gave me my apple back, then taking a big, giant bite out of the still-refrigerated granny smith apple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, I thought it was cool at least to remember something so far back. It&#39;s not my oldest memory (I remember some odd tidbits from Hawaii), but it may be one of the earliest of Renton, which I generally consider as the site of my &#39;childhood&#39;, since I generally see myself as a grown-up by the time I lived in Colorado.</content>

   <content type="html">Yesterday afternoon, Uberboss asked if I&#39;d like to tagalong and be the &#39;token foreigner who makes the company look more important&#39; guy at a billion+ yuan project proposal to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanxun_District&quot;&gt;Nanxun City Government&lt;/a&gt; in Zheijang. The city is super old, and was the site of silk-growers for a long time. They&#39;re mostly countryside, but they have an enormous government building complex sitting in the middle of a bunch of agrarian fields. They want to change that, it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We walked into the conference room, and everyone sat facing east, except for the executive bureaucrat, who sat on the other longside of the conference table alone facing west. I and others who weren&#39;t directly participating sat along the wall, and I was dead center in front of the mayor-equivalent. On the left were the architects, who gave pretty impressive building plans, in the center slightly in front of me was a councilwoman, and to my right was a group of (I presume) local relevant advisors (building codes, financier, etc). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was all conducted in chinese, but because I had to be &#39;the foreign guy&#39;, I used my advanced skills in figuring out what people are on about to look quite important. It was funny that, because I was looking alert and understanding, the mayor basically ended up addressing me in chinese most of the two-hour meeting, so I&#39;d nod understandingly and stuff. He caught me after the meeting and starting talking to me in Chinese, but he was completely floored that I didn&#39;t actually know any. He said I was &#39;very cool, and a great help to my company&#39;, and I just smiled and thanked him: I didn&#39;t even know which architect I was supposed to be rooting for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#39;m in Hanzhou (a relatively picturesque garden city, although it has plenty of factory smokestacks too?) and am being taken by the Uberboss&#39; business friend to tour around a bit. I&#39;ll have to ask to borrow a camera, since I didn&#39;t get to hit my house for my camera before being whisked out here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is super weird that I was taken out here as a luck charm.</content>

It&#39;s pretty awesome, and I can actually draw on my laptop now. Quite recommended: it&#39;s like having a gazillion pens, markers, pastels, and some brushes once you get the settings tuned.</content>

   <content type="html">Rainy tuesday, bleh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just working here, although almost all the creative part of the job is behind me: it&#39;s making list after list now, and not having any player game data to play with for at least a month. Keeping on top of it, but it certainly isn&#39;t as dynamic at the moment as it often can be. Working on various small projects at the moment creatively off-work, such as practicing my dialog-writing skills, working on my language (came up with how I&#39;m gonna do names, if you haven&#39;t noticed), and other things. Am going on a safari this weekend with Chris, so will make sure to get pictures as long as we don&#39;t get rained out. Hope all is going well for you all!</content>

   <content type="html">Well, it seems the wet season has hit Shanghai, and everything is covered in rain. It made me think of the lovely summer weather Seattle is supposed to have. The Koppen Climate Classification is a way of, naturally, classifying climates of certain places. Shanghai is Humid Temperate - Hot Summer, also called Cf-a. Seattle is Humid Temperate - Cool Summer, also called Cf-b. Since I generally love the weather of the Pacific Northwest (as opposed to the more humid/hot East Coast or Coastal China), I looked up a world climate map and tried to find places I&#39;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are all the Cf-b regions I could find: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pacific Northwest&lt;br /&gt;Very South Fjords of Chile&lt;br /&gt;Lower right-side coast of South africa&lt;br /&gt;United Kingdom&lt;br /&gt;North of France&lt;br /&gt;Belgium&lt;br /&gt;Netherlands&lt;br /&gt;Germany&lt;br /&gt;Denmark&lt;br /&gt;South Sweden&lt;br /&gt;Norwegian coast&lt;br /&gt;Tasmania&lt;br /&gt;South Western Australian coast&lt;br /&gt;New Zealand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on this, here are some cities I might like to live in:&lt;br /&gt;Seattle, USA&lt;br /&gt;Vancouver, Canada&lt;br /&gt;Portland, USA&lt;br /&gt;Dublin, Ireland&lt;br /&gt;London, UK&lt;br /&gt;Liverpool, UK&lt;br /&gt;Edinburgh, UK&lt;br /&gt;Lille, France&lt;br /&gt;Brest, France&lt;br /&gt;Paris, France&lt;br /&gt;Brussels, Belgium&lt;br /&gt;Amsterdam, Netherlands&lt;br /&gt;Hamburg, Germany&lt;br /&gt;Frankfurt, Germany&lt;br /&gt;Berlin, Germany&lt;br /&gt;Copenhagen, Denmark&lt;br /&gt;Gdansk, Poland&lt;br /&gt;Prague, Czech Republic&lt;br /&gt;Oslo, Norway&lt;br /&gt;Trondheim, Norway&lt;br /&gt;Stockholm, Sweden&lt;br /&gt;Gdansk, Poland&lt;br /&gt;Port Elizabeth, South Africa&lt;br /&gt;Puerto Aisen, Chile&lt;br /&gt;Melbourne, Australia&lt;br /&gt;Canberra, Australia&lt;br /&gt;Hobart, Australia&lt;br /&gt;Wellington, New Zealand&lt;br /&gt;Auckland, New Zealand&lt;br /&gt;Christchurch, Ne Zealand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so, yeah... pretty good selection I think!</content>

   <content type="html">Work is coming along well, although my tasks have petered out creativity-wise: it&#39;s mostly just coordinating people and tweaking large lists, since it&#39;s mostly up to programmers and artists now. I find summer in China to be oppressively humid and hot, so I have to admit I&#39;ve been loathe to do anything other than hit work and hide in my room. =)</content>

   <content type="html">I&#39;ve been playing the original campaign of Neverwinter Nights to pass the time at home in the evenings: I&#39;ve never actually finished it before. And man... it is a colossal game. Having spent what feels like a hundred hours on it, I&#39;m just now halfway through it! I&#39;m playing a elven Fighter/Thief, and am rocking a pretty mean longsword at the moment. I always play F/T because it is nice to just steamroll over encounters and pick up all the loot afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the &#39;not spend China playing computer games department&#39;, it&#39;s been really muggy and uncomfortable out the past few days. Despite that, I&#39;ve been going to the French, Italian, and German restaurants, and am really spending a little too much on the lovely food: I&#39;ve developed a liking for red wine too. I still order Stella for my beer though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A new programming intern guy has come out, so it&#39;s cool to have a new friend: his name is Matt and he&#39;s from Cambridge, England. He has a pretty thick Lennonesque accent, but we&#39;ll Americanize his speech eventually through peer pressure ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#39;re about to finish a major development milestone for the game, so I&#39;m excited to reset and approach the second phase with a fresh head. I&#39;m thinking I might book a fast train to Beijing and see the tanks.</content>

   <content type="html">Pretty slow week: just recharging and getting ready for the last push for development. I&#39;ve been coming up with some new game ideas, and I&#39;ll propose one to Zhang soonish, although I imagine that he&#39;d wait to come on board for another project until the end of this one. I am thinking of how/when I&#39;ll get a little vacation while I&#39;m here in China, since I haven&#39;t ventured beyond Shanghai Municipality nor Jiangsu or Anhui Province.</content>

   <content type="html">Sadly, I had my bike stolen Saturday night from out in front of work: it was locked and stuff, but it&#39;s light enough that they probably just lifted it into a truckbed. A shame, but isn&#39;t a huge loss and was fun while it lasted. I likely won&#39;t get a replacement. Probably for the best: riding without plates or helmet was starting to attract unwanted attention from the beefed up police presence (for the World Expo). I did get a package from Dad, though, so that&#39;s pretty sweet!</content>

   <content type="html">I brought two books with me to China, largely for airplane-fodder. Sadly, I had thought there&#39;d be books in English in specialty bookstores, but I was disappointed: they only really carry &quot;Let&#39;s Learn Chinese&quot;, &quot;Let&#39;s Learn English&quot;, and &quot;A Hundred Phrases for the Aspiring Emigree&quot;, OR recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/pages/books/bestseller/&quot;&gt;publisher Bestsellers&lt;/a&gt; like &quot;The Audacity of Hope&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter and The Belated Sequel&quot;, and such. What I&#39;d much prefer is a nice solid midlist book selection, but I assume that, given the hassles of book importation to the PRC (both legal and logistical) and the mercurialness of the likely customer&#39;s tastes, it is hard to avoid relying on sure-profitable books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so I&#39;ve been rereading my two books over about every four weeks, and last night I finished a re-read of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Titanicus&lt;/span&gt; by Dan Abnett, since I wasn&#39;t ready to plow my way through &lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Titus Groan&lt;/span&gt; by Mervyn Peake again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Titanicus is a nice solid geek-fest with giant robots, straightforward characters, and plenty of combat sequences, and so it makes for a nice relaxing read. I imagine it&#39;s a lot like Grandma&#39;s mysteries in entertainment value (except for the fact I doubt there are giant robots and lasgun combat sequences in the mysteries, haha). Having read Titanicus a few times now, and some other books by the author, I have to conclude however that it is not quite as solid plot-wise as most of his other books. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the MacGuyver at the end tends to spoil the book a bit for me (the Archenemy needs to get its act together if a homemade bomb made from piss, screw washers, and nytrate can get pulled through an entire parade ground of troops by a ragged crew of 5 and hit the Weak Spot). I also thought that the resolution for Cally was anticlimatic: she was leading her PDF remnant through all sorts of spiky baddies the whole book, and it ends with her getting a pat on the back and a dead husband, without even a cinematic out: I get the feeling that her injured charge was supposed to be a real interesting sneak through enemy lines, but Abnett realized the book was getting a bit thick for a paperback and cut it off early. I thought Moderati Tarses was real cool, but in the end he was shoehorned into the &quot;Oh Noes A Invictus/Tempestus Commanded Titan in the Middle of Heresy&quot; role. And there were entire characters unused: the gardener guy was intriguing, and added next to nothing to the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the book is solid and  gripping for the first 600 pages, but I felt the tying-off of the several plot lines in the last 100 felt like it was rushed and maybe under publication pressures.</content>

   <content type="html">After noticing that I was able to see a little bit of bone-definition by my sternum a week ago, being unable to lift much weight, and after long having an ache-y back, I&#39;ve been trying to be a bit more healthy lately. Towards this end, I&#39;ve started stretching before and after sleeping, going on more walks, and even doing push-ups lately. When I first started a week ago, I could only do 3 proper push-ups before the burn was too much, but this morning I did a full proper 25 before I had to stop. The stretching (mostly focused on my arms, neck, shoulders, and sides) is helping me sleep better at night too, so apart from my little hay fever, I&#39;ve been feeling overall more healthy as of late.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Although I doubt I&#39;ll end up lifting weights, doing pull-ups, or even being particularly muscular, at least my energy is up and I ache less!&lt;/div&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">It is impossible to find salted peanuts in China: only MSG ones. Although they taste alright, they bring a sweetness to the snack that I am not looking for when I&#39;d much prefer an over-salty/dry legume.  At least you can get them de-shelled but still have that papery-brown membrane on the kernels.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This weekend, I&#39;m going to ride out (rain permitting) to the ocean by Shanghai on my moped and see what it is like. I&#39;ll actively lower my expectations over the week though, because smart money says that the ocean probably looks as polluted as the Huangpu.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&#39;ve been playing a first-person shooter game called Counterstrike with the people at work: it&#39;s Artists vs. Programmers/Designers, and it is very fun to be able to shoot my bosses through the head with a semi-automatic.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Humidity, poor air quality conditions, and stagnant-feeling rain are causing mold to spring up into the air here in Shanghai, and so I&#39;ve been struck with a kind of hay fever which has left me all stuffy. I&#39;ve been taking care to air-condition my room (de-humidifies) and casually ride my bike (moving air) to ease the symptoms.&lt;/div&gt;</content>

It has a small gas tank, and it looks like it&#39;s 90km/City, 120/Country. It rides just like a bicycle, except goes about 10 times as fast. I&#39;ve ridden 100km on it around the maze of streets this weekend, and am hoping to get my plates in a week maybe, and maybe a helmet. This is certainly a lot different learning-to-drive experience than highway driving in a sedan! I&#39;ve only had one &quot;Eek!&quot; moment so far (a mean chinese guy tried to run me off the road), but even that I handled with (I think) excellent reaction time. I sincerely believe that if I can learn to drive in Shanghai, I can drive anywhere.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It&#39;s registered under my chinese name &lt;i&gt;Ai De Hua&lt;/i&gt;, which apparantly means &#39;the love of words&#39; and sounds vaguely like &#39;Edward&#39;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And yes, I&#39;ll be very very careful ;-)&lt;/div&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">Ahoy!&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;All the new programmers have arrived, so have been spending lots of time meeting new people, which&#39;s been nice. I&#39;ve gotten quite good at ping pong, so the new opponents are appreciated. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And some geekiness: I&#39;ve been sinking my teeth deep into a game of Emperor of the Fading Suns using the Nova patch: I&#39;m playing a random galaxy as House Hazat, and am stomping over Holy Terra and the other Houses, waging planetary war on the Church, Al-Malik, and Hawkwood simultaneously with universal warehouse off, which is quite a logistical feat given the roughly two hundred troops I am ferrying towards the respective targets (primarily hover tanks and marauder legions). You can&#39;t run away with sceptors in this patch (they can&#39;t be transported), so doing raids on the palaces have to be full-on occupation efforts. I have 20 out of the 35 sceptors in the game, but I had promised departments before this, so I am actually doing all these massive invasions while fighting against the Imperial Navy and the Stigmata Garrison (Aragon is right next to Stigmata in this galaxy &gt;_&lt;) with my own home-grown fleet of invasion landers, meson starbases, and battle cruisers loaded with Prophet torpedoe fighters: I am particularly eager to make headway against Hawkwood so that I can get access to Delphi&#39;s gem resources so I can get more ships made. I hope to take Holy Terra, Delphi, and Ishtakhr within thirty to forty turns, and will declare myself Emperor once I&#39;ve conquered them and assassinated their nobles on Byzantium II, although I might delay it if I feel like doing a Reconquista on the Symbiot worlds. Fun =)&lt;/div&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">It was a three day weekend, since Monday was Qingming, translated to me as &#39;Tombsweeping Day&#39; or &#39;Mourning Day&#39;: it&#39;s about remembering ancestors and visiting gravesites. Sean, Chris, and I spent the day walking out on BeiDi road and then BeiQing Highway and walked straight out of Shanghai Municipality: roughly 50km on foot through construction and countryside. At the end was the &#39;communist china&#39; one sees in movies, with people walking out of factories which look out over fields of safflowers with peasants planting. It was really cool, and I had brought my camera, but sadly I didn&#39;t realize I was out of battery power =(. Total fail on my part, but oh well: we&#39;re hoping to take mopeds down the coast to Hong Kong in a couple weeks, and so I should be able to see similar terrain and take good pictures.</content>

   <content type="html">Well, I&#39;ve been hesitant to write this, but I figure everyone should know.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&#39;ve decided that, given the lower cost of living, the job opportunities, and the ability to have nice dinners all the time, I&#39;ve decided to stay in China indefinitely. Although I will miss being in the land of burgers and fries, I think this is the best way forward, and that I can do without English reading material if I can pick up the lovely Chinese language. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&#39;m courting a girl, and her parents like me enough that I think it will work out great: her father has already given me the nickname of Gweilo! I&#39;m looking forward to having one child some day, and having my wife give me an allowance of my own salary: we will maybe even buy a house with a special room with a lock where we can make our child the brightest and most talented and most wonderful little doctor. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Another good thing is that there are no homeless scum in Shanghai, and I can walk unaccosted by the degenerate subhumans. Also, because I consider the Chinese as white brothers, Shanghai also doesn&#39;t have any stinky colored people, and I so can make lots of money without having to care about anyone.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I make this decision knowing full well the effect it might have on my loved ones, but I figure you could always fly over and visit. I simply can&#39;t pass up all of this, or else I&#39;d be caught the fool.&lt;/div&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">One interesting thing about China is that, when a shop goes out of business, it is stripped down to drywall within 24 hours of its last business. What this means is that, having gone there the day before and had a dinner, I&#39;ll go &quot;oh nice, I&#39;ll go again today&quot; and find it to be cordoned off and the inside bare concrete. It&#39;s really startling when it happens, and it seems to happen regularly!</content>

   <content type="html">Living in Shanghai last week was like living in a heavy-fire warzone, except the artillery didn&#39;t usually destroy anything. I was expecting that the Chinese would do a large firework show over the river or something, and that&#39;d be largely it other than the occasional firecracker. There was no organized firework show: instead, every Shanghaier spent I&#39;d guess about 1000rmb on ordnance.

If you&#39;ve ever seen some of the grittier WW2 movies, any kind of night-time aerial bombardment of a city, that is what New Year&#39;s was like: clouds of gunpowder smoke meandering through the streets, there was so much iodine and particulate in the air that what was supposed to be a slightly humid night resulted in snow falling thick over entire street intersections littered 2-3cm deep of firework cardboard. I&#39;d like to emphasize the fact I am not using hyperbole or any kind of exaggeration! It was like walking through autumn leaves much of the time, there was so much fireworks on the streets. 1000rmb bought you either 10-minutes of mega-firecrackers, or roughly 16 mortars of explosive fireworks (these two being the most popular to do). When 19,213,200 live in a city, and each family spends about 1400rmb or so, you can imagine the firepower! &lt;div&gt;It was like that for a week, the sky lighting up constantly with explosions until about 2 in the morning. It was really very cool! Sadly, fireworks are *quite* difficult to get pictures of on my camera, as it goes into nighttime mode and tends to only catch the fading light (it&#39;s a bit slow on the click). Just imagine the biggest fireworks show you&#39;ve gone and went to, and then put that right next to your apartment building, and move the explosions down from hundreds of feet above to just about the third story: I swear that there was only enough in the mortar and the fuse was just short enough so that the firework explosion didn&#39;t hit the ground (although perhaps only a foot overhead). No such precaution about not hitting people&#39;s windows though! The above pictures&#39; show very often had the shells bouncing off the apartment windows, resulting in truncated spheres of explosions, the rest showering off the walls.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">Much to my chagrin on this beautiful Sunday, I&#39;m at work getting ready to start a work day. The Chinese have a bizarre approach to holidays: the days you get &#39;off&#39; aren&#39;t actually &#39;off&#39;, but are largely compensated by sprinkling work days on the weekends throughout the year. Today and Yesterday go towards compensating the Lunar New Year, and the practice seems to be a universal one in China.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This&#39;d&#39;ve meant that I was in work yesterday, but I was notified on short notice and so I refused to come in on a Saturday. I wouldn&#39;t&#39;ve come in today, but I&#39;m going to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingdao&quot;&gt;Qingdao&lt;/a&gt; (to get my Visa extended comfortably past my stay&#39;s completion) on business expense, and I&#39;d have to take a day off during the workweek, so I consented to working it off ahead of time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&#39;ll be composing my Lunar New Year post, which should have several nice pictures, throughout today and it should be my post for tomorrow =)&lt;/div&gt;</content>

I usually write them on my laptop and then transmit over the wireless to my work computer, but they&#39;ve shut down the router. Doing well, and will give a nice summary blog for this week this monday, but I&#39;m at the kindness of the janitor, hehe =)</content>

   <content type="html">Another day, another post!&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Chinese New Year is this weekend, and so I really need to get some plans together for Saturday and the following week (which I get off). I&#39;d prefer to hang out with the locals, since I figure they know how to have fun on the New Year&#39;s eve, but my default plan is to go fireworks watching over the Bund.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Today, though, is just work. No real sign of work fatigue yet though, since I still look forward to coming in just about every work-morning: can&#39;t say that&#39;s been a common experience, haha!&lt;/div&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">Ahoyez Vous!&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This weekend I did very little other than relax on the couch and programming/conlanging, since it was quite wet and no one was free to hang out. It was alright: I tried my hand at getting a genetic algorithm to work, and almost got it, except there is a bug I cannot seem to fix with my selection algorithm, which doesn&#39;t seem to work at all for some subtlety of reason beyond my capacity. Irritated, I just focused on thinking up all the verbal forms in Jezzali I could think of: I remember thinking to myself &quot;Nah Ed, you won&#39;t need to bring &lt;i&gt;Describing Morphosyntax &lt;/i&gt;by Thomas Payne to China, you can leave it here in Seattle&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It&#39;s always the book you don&#39;t bring... =\&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also, need to find if &lt;i&gt;Gormenghast&lt;/i&gt; by Mervyn Peake is in any of the foreign bookstores, since I just finished the preceding book in the series.&lt;/div&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">Ahoy!&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Been working hard, but it&#39;s the kind of hard work you do when you are actually into the job, so am having a blast. It&#39;s still work, with deadlines and stuff, but I really do quite enjoy what I&#39;m doing at the moment, and the people are cool. I&#39;ll try to take a picture of each of my friends in my next batch of alkaline batteries... I think I keep running out because I only ever take one picture every time I turn my camera on: I know the pictures I wanna take, and feel like the worst kind of tourist when I go around taking many photos at a go. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Apparantly there is a big company dinner tonight, and those are always pretty ritzy (with Budweiser, it has to be classy...) and so that should be fun.&lt;/div&gt;</content>

I also wanted some of the background smell to get washed away and get replaced with Seattle-ish air, if only for a day.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well, the rain isn&#39;t as crisp as it is in the states, and it seems only to have made the streets muddier, so oh well. Today should be an interesting day at work, since I&#39;m switching to another task for a while to avoid burnout on my previous task: should be fun!&lt;/div&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">Tuesday January 26 0838&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Things are going pretty well, although I have to admit I don&#39;t do much on the weekdays that I can discuss about here: work does go well, however, and it is an exciting project to work on! I&#39;m being given a free hand to do my part, and so it is nice being able to design creatively with little pressure other than to communicate what my design decisions are to the team members. It&#39;s a great workplace, with cool bosses (!), great coworkers, and ping pong over free lunches.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sunday, I went to a tea ceremony with two chinese girls who had approached me in the park and invited me, and it was very fun until I saw what my part of the bill was: 344 rmb! I only had 85rmb, so the lady from the tea ceremony had to come with me on the subway to Jing An where Blake loaned me the debt (I paid Blake back that afternoon). No hard feelings any which way, I don&#39;t think, and I learned a few important lessons:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always ask how much&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chinese girls on holiday like to bring foreigners to expensive fun things&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tea can be made really complicated!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">Friday January 22 0838&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yesterday, I had a pretty good day at work, mostly teaching myself &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sqlite.org/&quot;&gt;SQLite&lt;/a&gt;: it should come in handy for my work! I&#39;m having &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiaozi&quot;&gt;jiao-zi&lt;/a&gt; right now with what I assume has a chicken (rather than a gou or mao) filling. I also picked up some Fanta, since I&#39;ve found that my preferred Pepsi over here isn&#39;t as consistently &#39;good&#39; as it is in the states. On an interesting note, it is nigh impossible to find Sprite, but 7up is everywhere, which is sad, because Sprite is much better.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This weekend, I won&#39;t have internet access again (since Garrett is gone until Tuesday, I can&#39;t take him wifi router shopping). However, I am kind of glad I don&#39;t have internet at the apartment because it discourages me from spending my evenings in front of the computer, so I will likely only get a wifi router if Garrett pushes for it. This weekend, I will likely go to bars with Sean this evening, go to the building where the first meeting of the Chinese Communist Party was held on Saturday, and then on Sunday go to English Corner and try to make a friend or two. As for today, ping pong and work! :-)&lt;/div&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">Monday January 18 2345&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today after work, Chris was very kind and took me to a Japanese restaurant, where we had a very nice meal for 102rmb (about 30$) which consisted of some quite spicy beef in rice with spring rolls, dumplings, and an exquisite fried chicken with some delightfully subtle sauces flourished on top. The whole thing was really very yummy, and I need to make sure I treat him to a nice meal sometime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, we went back to the office to retrieve his forgotten keys and I ended up playing ping-pong with Sean for several hours over a beer or two: he gets philosophical when he drinks, so it was fun to chat while I tried furiously to counteract his spinning curve-serve. (I&#39;ve yet to figure out how to react).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, I returned back to the flat and wished Garrett a good trip before heading in to bed. Quite a pleasant day, and I hope that such nice days become the &#39;routine&#39; days that fill in between more eventful days.</content>

   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/prcblog/2010/01/18/sunday-january-17-2032</id>
   <content type="html">Today I took a morning walk in search of a park to practice my ocarina a little bit in. I had a bit of difficulty, but did find a little one several streets down off of Changzhou Lu (Lu=road). It was a beautiful day, with little smog in the blue sky and the air temperature had increased a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a text from Chris asking if I wanted to go to People&#39;s Square and visit English Corner, and so I met him in front of work and we took an 18RMB taxi out of Jing An for Huangpu District. We got some KFC and a Pepsi and headed into the beautiful, bustling park. The last time I&#39;d been here was with Blake at night, where we had mostly been underground, so this was the first time I got a good look at the large park. We arrived at a nice little shaded plaza, where a group of Shanghaiers were sitting around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon sight of us, they got up and approached us: Chris introduced me as his coworker, and then I quickly found we had two small crowds around us. You see, English Corner is named such not because it is particularly British, but because it is a place where Shanghaiers go to practice their English with native speakers. They get authentic, free English practice, whereas the foreigners get to have a limelight in return and meet people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so I talked and talked and talked for several hours, and was asked where I came from by every person. Chicago was held high in esteem by several, but I couldn&#39;t talk about it much since all I&#39;ve ever done is drive through it. Most of them were men about my age or much older, but a few pairs of girls stopped and chatted, and that was nice. I found the experience, although pleasant, a bit draining: the nature of the arrangement is such that the conversation tends to be a bit one-sided, with roughly a dozen people asking and expecting answers of the same foreigner. Although I mingled well, interacting with groups of people has always been a fatiguing thing for me, so Chris and I left early. I do plan to go back next Sunday: maybe I can get better at group conversationalism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, Chris and I took the taxi back to Jing An, where we ran into Blake on the street: he had just gotten duplicate keys made, since Sean tends to lose his housekey. Chris and I continued on to work where we played ping pong for a while, and we practiced our games. After that, we went to our homes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later that evening, I remembered I needed batteries from Carrefour, and so stepped back out onto the streets. However, instead of going up Yuyao to Wuning and carrying straight past Changzhou, I decided to follow Xiening (I think that&#39;s the name) towards the river. There was a small, under-construction bridge which I went over, and quickly found myself in a network of alleys straight out of Bladerunner: clothing hung just overhead from lines, the alleys were tight, boxes and fire-barrels littered around amongst the merchants and people living their evenings. This was a place, I could tell, that saw very very few foreigners. It was pretty neat, and I bought a round of sweet bread from a man for 1rmb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I had finished exploring this neat place, I walked up to Wuning Rd (once I found an exit from the warren), crossed over the bridge (I will get a picture of it at night, it is quite cool) and got batteries at Carrefour. I grabbed dinner on the way back (fried rice) and am now back at the apartment, likely to turn in early. Tomorrow I&#39;ll be looking to take a few pictures and find a good way to put them online, so expect some pictures (finally!) in some of the following posts.</content>

   <id>http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/prcblog/2010/01/18/saturday-jan-16-2322</id>
   <content type="html">Today, I woke up and went in front of work to meet Chris and Blake to go to Yuyuan Garden, a rather large bazaar. It was such a bustling place and bargaining flurry that I find it difficult to write down the series of events, but the general state that I found myself in was that of poking into hundreds of stands each with odd little baubles and goods, with the air loud and crowds omnipresent. Blake was our bargainer: all merchants initially state six times the price of their product, and it is wholly on the buyer to not pay such ridiculous prices.One has to walk away at *least* twice and have the merchant chase you before you can get a good bargain: no &#39;sales&#39; here, only haggling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, the idea of haggling over a price is extremely alien, but seeing the kick that Blake got out of chaining four merchants on him, each of which he had engaged in haggling, showed that bargaining can be a true pasttime! I felt like a pied piper with my new ocarina, doodling little notes as Blake became the bane of every shopkeeper: foreigners aren&#39;t supposed to be good at bargaining, so Blake was called (I believe) &#39;bu ren&#39;, or &quot;bad man&quot;, by some of the ladies he had gotten bargains I&#39;d&#39;ve never thought they&#39;d allow. For example, Chris&#39; eye was caught by t-shirts in his size, and he had bargained the lady down to 1 shirt for 100rmb. Blake intervened, and while I stood and looked at the stand, the woman and Blake traded &quot;too much!&quot; and &quot;great price, just for you! no lower!&quot; until Chris had 3 shirts for 100rmb with the lady mumbling curses as we left. Insane! I got an ocarina (76rmb, fixed price) and a timepiece (80rmb from 200) that I hold to be the Platonic Ideal of all &#39;Baubles&#39;: every other little gizmo is but a physical instantiation of this particular watch-in-a-crystal-ball. It&#39;s like an old pocket watch, but encased in crystal: quite cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris headed back home in a taxi, but Blake and I caught a cab to Eric&#39;s house, the same place I first visited in Shanghai. There, I got to have this *DELICIOUS* Szechuan sausage that Eric&#39;s mother had sent in the mail: it was savory, spicy, and stuffed into intestine. Also there were what I *think* was bok-choi in a deliciously spicy sauce that you can only get from Szechuan: I would have gobbled it all up, but it was too spicy, and so my body rebelled against the heat, even though I quite loved the hot taste. I then played (for Blake and Eric&#39;s entertainment) some PS3 games, the most awesome of which was Little Bigplanet, which is possibly the purest form of innocent, unadulterated fun I&#39;ve ever found in a console game: if I ever bought a PS3, it&#39;d be specifically for that game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We then met Eric&#39;s wife and went by the river near Huangpu District and took in the night skyline, seeing The Bund at night, walking around and staring up at the skyscrapers with Blake and I practicing our Chinese. I wish I hadn&#39;t been hungover in the morning so I could have gotten batteries for my camera, but I will be here for months, so will get my pictures eventually. There were candle-balloons being launched from the river that night by people, and they speckled the sky with little candlelights: it was very beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some phrases I&#39;ve learned this week (not sure about the spelling... writing how they sound to my ears)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ni hao - Hello&lt;br /&gt;Zai Jian - Goodbye&lt;br /&gt;Xie Xie - Thank You (My *most* common utterance this week in Chinese)&lt;br /&gt;Doibushi - Sorry&lt;br /&gt;Wo shi Meguo - I am American&lt;br /&gt;Ta shi Inguo - He is British (usually about Chris)&lt;br /&gt;Ni shwou Fa wen ma? - Do you speak French? (to discourage peddlers, who barely know any English, let alone French)&lt;br /&gt;Ni shwou Ing wen ma? - Do you speak English?&lt;br /&gt;Bu - bad, not&lt;br /&gt;Duay - yes, correct (like d + french ouais)&lt;br /&gt;Hao - good&lt;br /&gt;Yi - One&lt;br /&gt;Bu yao - don&#39;t want&lt;br /&gt;Ma - question marker, comes at end&lt;br /&gt;Chur - eat&lt;br /&gt;Xihuan - to like&lt;br /&gt;Ni xihuan chur mao ma? - Do you want to eat cat?&lt;br /&gt;Wo bu yao, Bukene! - I don&#39;t want! Impossible!</content>

   <content type="html">Friday Jan 15 1645&lt;br /&gt;Almost end of work here, and I get the weekends off. I don&#39;t have internet access at the apartment yet, so I may not be able to post the next two days: I will write my blogs like usual on my laptop into text files, but I might have to post them Monday. Will try to get internet though: just don&#39;t worry that I got hit by a bus or anything... even though it is quite possible, I am being particularly paranoid about not being roadkill (Dad would hate crossing the streets here, lol).</content>

   <content type="html">Friday January 15 0758&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday, I woke up and did a walkabout before work, getting comfortable with the area immediately next to my workplace. I didn&#39;t see much new stuff I hadn&#39;t seen before, but the morning pedestrian rush is impressive: they get a lot of crossguards and police to enforce the jaywalking laws, otherwise traffic would be completely and utterly halted. I went to Carrefour to get a Pepsi, then went to work, where I mostly just worked hard all day: it&#39;s Thursday, and so the weekly deadlines are due Friday leading to people being a bit more absorbed in their work than the Wednesday I came: even the artists were all working quite diligently rather than playing games or watching movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After work, Blake took me to People&#39;s Square, which is home to a rather extensive below-ground market. The result being like a hybrid between Pike Place Market in Seattle and a high-class Macy&#39;s, it was full of &quot;girly&quot; shops. I was looking for a pair of practical, affordable shoes, which became quite a task indeed. We eventually found a Nike shop, which had a shoe big enough for my feet: although my shoe size isn&#39;t that large for in the states, here in China it is hard to find a shoe larger than a Men&#39;s 9. We stopped for a Subway, then got onto the subway back to Jing&#39;An Temple, which is near where I work (today I plan to buy AA batteries, and will start taking pictures).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so I came back to the apartment and played on my computer, and went to bed early: I hadn&#39;t gotten a long sleep the night before. This morning, the sky is a bit cloudy + smoggy, and I&#39;m having hot chocolate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life is good!</content>

   <content type="html">Wednesday Jan 13 2010&lt;br /&gt;Well gee: I&#39;m a bit drunk I suppose, but still coherent enough to type without penalty, so I figure it is best to record how my day went while it is fresh in mind. What a great day, though!&lt;br /&gt;I woke up, wrote my previous entry, and waited for what seemed like hours until my roommate and project leader, Garrett, was up. I would have wandered in the very near vicinity of the building, except for the fact that I had forgotten to get a pair of keys (one for the flat and one for the complex), and so I spent the time writing my blog entry so that I could copy+paste it later that day at work. Garrett came out of his room fully dressed (great-coat and all), and so I was glad I already had the dress shoes Mom had bought me at Alek&#39;s wedding on. We went down the stairs (we&#39;re on the sixth and highest floor) and into the bright, crisp Shanghai morning.&lt;br /&gt;Garrett asked me &quot;Do you have favorite breakfast you like have?&quot; and offered to stop either at the bakery right near the apartment complex, or a convenience store further down Yunyao Lu. Although a bit of bread sounded good, I wanted to practice my Chinese street interaction skills more, so I indicated I would like some cereal from the convenience store. And so we walked, and I pointed out blindingly obvious things like &quot;boy, traffic laws are a formality here&quot; and &quot;in the States, it is unusual to hang your panties out your window&quot; and such, mostly making Garrett laugh.&lt;br /&gt;We stepped into this semi-claustrophobic 7-11 equivalent, where Garret indicated that we could find cereal or maybe a biscuit. We went to the right aisle, where we found granola-type stuff. I made a comment (which I now kinda regret) that usually I prefer Corn Flakes, or other &#39;normal&#39; kinds of cereal. He asked if maybe I&#39;d prefer a biscuit: thinking of the kind you get at KFC, I thought that might indeed be a good breakfast with some milk and honey and replied in the affirmative. Unfortunately, I soon realized (when he went to the snack aisle) that not only was I facing a Chinese language barrier, but also a British one: he was talking about cookies. Knowing that I&#39;d have to write a blog post explaining to Mom why my first breakfast in China was a package of Oreos if I took the easy way out and just bought them, I instead navigated a needlessly overcomplicated conversation culminating in an arcane &quot;instant&quot; substance that apparantly turned hot water into yummy cereal. Satisfied, and performing my first 2.80 yuan transaction (thank god that Arabic numerals are used on the register&#39;s display), my boss/roommate went down Yunyao Lu towards South Wuning Lu, where the office is situated, roughly 4 blocks away.&lt;br /&gt;We&#39;re on the third floor. We walked in and I met my first coworker: the receptionist, Grace. She is native Chinese, and very likely native Shanghaihese: she has auburn-red dyed hair. She knows only a little bit of English, but I can tell she is quite a characterful person. I made a special point to remember her name, since I guessed that she would be the one who would order lunch and make coffee for me (I was right) and so I have made sure to be extra nice to her, especially since the room she sits in seemed quite cold: I always greet her by name and wave whenever I go through. Garrett then took me left down a hall, then right past a frosted glass wall with &quot;AFM Games&quot; stenciled, and then a quick left into the studio.&lt;br /&gt;Houston? We have a ping-pong table.&lt;br /&gt;The workplace is in two salient sections: the larger floor that has the ping pong table, and the smaller adjunct floorspace that doesn&#39;t. The ping-pong room has artists on all the walls, who are also masters of retrieving and deflecting (often with their heads and chairs) ping pong balls: I have come to appreciate how exemplary in their stoicism they are in the face of hollow plastic spheres hurtling towards them at speeds of approximately 60kph, and they are surely about as brave as the intrepid jaywalkers of Shanghai.&lt;br /&gt;The other floorspace is where the game-designers work: our space has the door leading to Garrett&#39;s office, and the ping-pong room is where Eric&#39;s office is (I learned later that Eric is actually the one responsible for the whole of AFM Games: I had had him confused with Sean, who I met later in the day). Here, I was introduced to several people at once by Garrett. I actually felt quite trepidated, since I wanted to make sure I gave a proper personal greeting to everyone, but because everyone&#39;s desks were facing the walls and I was in the center of the room, I almost felt assailed by greetings from all sides, and really very much tried to meet them all non-generically. Sadly, I was unable to achieve such a herculean feat of tact, so I prioritized meeting the people nearby Blake, who I met in person for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;Although it probably isn&#39;t of any illustrative value to most who will read this, Blake is almost exactly the same in carriage and manner as my best dormitory roommate of college: Neal Finne. As a result, I felt very comfortable and able to communicate with him. I also met Chris and Li Hao and &#39;Jason&#39;. Garrett said he&#39;d be in his office if I needed anything, and Blake took his cue and introduced me to much of the staff.&lt;br /&gt;(In writing this, I realize that this is actually going to get quite long if I go in this much detail. However, I also realize that it&#39;d be best to write too much than too little. If you are getting a little weary of this wall of text, the short version is that I had a pleasant day at work, wherein I played much ping-pong and essentially set up my workstation so that I could be ready for tomorrow. Later this evening, I was taken out to dinner by Garrett along with all the programmer-types to a fancy-shmancy-with-fancy-on-the-side dinner at the same table as the Uber-Boss, where I got quite drunk after several strategically targetted &quot;Gang-bai&quot;&#39;s against me and have returned tipsy to write this blog post. For more details, please, continue reading).&lt;br /&gt;Then next came a flurry of introductions: although the programmers were a bit more &#39;forthright&#39; with introducing themselves, the artists in the ping-pong room were a bit more reserved (possibly they predicted how wildflung my ping pong was at times, and their instincts to dodge and hide were perking up) but Blake did introduce me to the two (rather cute) girls first, then the various guys. I was impressed by the variety of the computer monitors: everything from 3dsmax to World of Warcraft were in attendance. Blake then took me to the rec room, and showed me how to get hot water and warm water (apparantly, due to the undrinkability of tap water, any &#39;fresh&#39; water you will get is actually quite warm since it has been boiled: throughout the day I was caught off guard by the fact that my glasses of water were actually a bit hot to the touch: I anticipate I will come to appreciate ice-cold water even more in the weeks to come).&lt;br /&gt;We went back to the studio, where the tech-guy was waiting. He asked Blake if he should install English XP on my workstation, and after a bit of fussing I caught the gist of the question. In a perhaps masochistic twist of fate, not wanting to burden the man with reinstalling an operating system onto a computer (an onerous task indeed), I indicated that I needn&#39;t have the OS reinstalled, and that my familiarity with the OS would be enough to use it. (As a result, I learned that Chinese have a word for &quot;Save&quot; &quot;Load&quot; and &quot;Close&quot; that don&#39;t begin with S, L, or C, and so the keyboard shortcuts are different... which meant that I had not the slightest clue which button in the menus went to what, being in Hanzi and all. I still haven&#39;t admitted I haven&#39;t the slightest clue what button I&#39;m pressing when trying to do rudimentary things like clicking &quot;Okay&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, I have this laptop, which I am now immensely grateful that I have: for a few months I was wondering if I had maybe splurged unnecessarily with my graduation money, but truth be told this laptop (along with Blake) are my linguistic sanity-hold now.&lt;br /&gt;About an hour later, Sean came in, another programmer. Around this time though, I had mixed my &quot;cereal&quot; and found that it was only passingly edible. Thankfully, Blake came over and said he was going to Carrefour (a French chain) to get stuff, and invited me along. Obliged, I left with him out the front (making sure to wave-smile-greet to Grace) and down into the noon-tide of Shanghai. We turned the corner and walked down South Wuning Lu, towards a 10-lane street.&lt;br /&gt;It was here that I learned that Blake is absolutely, stark-raving mad.&lt;br /&gt;In the states, there are these things called pedestrian walk-signals, where there is a little white guy who essentially says &quot;You can walk now, and you won&#39;t get brutally mauled by a ton of metal&quot;. There is also a big red hand that says &quot;You can&#39;t walk now, or you will get quite brutally mauled by a ton of metal&quot;. I had always taken these portentious signals as something heeded by all but the most callously foolhardy, and a mark of common-sense in its purest, most distilled manifestation.&lt;br /&gt;Blake, it&#39;d seem, has quite a callously foolhardy take on all that, and is simultaneously mad and an exemplar of bravery.&lt;br /&gt;Images of Ian being thrown 20 feet by vehicles on repeat on my mind, I found myself standing amidst swirling vehicular tranist from a combination of a desire to &quot;do as locals do&quot; and &quot;Blake *must* know what he&#39;s doing, right? And he counts as a local now... right?!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Harrowing indeed, but the fact that an old-old lady had enough confidence in me to use me as a meatshield--er, as an escort-- gave me the courage to not cower in the middle of the melee. And so we reached Carrefour.&lt;br /&gt;You know how, despite the widespread proliferation of music and (hopefully) musical aesthetic taste, supermarkets and department stores have a notorious taste in music? Well, we in the States are walking on clouds compared to the psychotic chorus permeating this Fred-Meyer-esque market. I don&#39;t even know how to describe it more precisely, so I won&#39;t. Suffice to say that after realizing that Blake is actually quite a celeritous walker (another trait he shares with Neal), I acquired a carton of milk and a new cellphone. He got a thing of olive oil (he&#39;s a vegetarian, so ends up having to cook his meals a lot more often since in China, although meat entrees are at a touch of a premium, most foods are soaked in broth of some variety) and we headed back to the office. The ten-laned street, in a stroke of mercy, had a little green guy letting everyone know that it was safe for Ed to cross.&lt;br /&gt;And so we returned. Here, Blake went off and did something, and I came to know Chris and Sean, the other two Englishmen of the studio besides Blake. We largely met over the ping-pong table: they are both rather good, but apparantly Eric and Garrett are *quite* good. Chris is a larger fellow who comes from the Isle of Man: he was quite impressed when I told him I knew where exactly it was, and we&#39;ve largely bonded over the bits of trivia about Britain I&#39;ve picked up from Richard: he was *quite* impressed that I knew what Weetabix was. He seems really nice, and has British sensabilities that I feel a bit familar of: he reminds me in many ways of Richard&#39;s brother, Mark.&lt;br /&gt;Sean fit into my categorization of &quot;online blake, british chris&quot; by being &quot;american sean&quot;, and is tall with auburn hair. He is a bit more social, and very easy to get along with, having a friendly but not overly-familiar manner. He has a goatee, and so is the only person I noticed at the studio other than me who has significant facial hair. He is also the guy who &quot;spikes&quot; the ball in ping-pong, and is the cause of many an artist&#39;s flinching.&lt;br /&gt;In lieu of overly long, possibly awkward introductions, we all played ping-pong. And I don&#39;t think I need to say anything more than that I learned quite a bit about the people who played by seeing how they played ping-pong. Blake holds back until he&#39;s sure the opponent is on his level, Chris plays reservedly and cares about a good, close game, and Sean plays best when his mind is on other things.&lt;br /&gt;(Oh geez, this is getting really *quite* long! I&#39;ll speed up a little to get to the dinner scene)&lt;br /&gt;The last person I met at the office today is the wonderful Tracey: the official translator for the bosses. She is wonderful not only because of her sanguine attitude, but also because she is friendly and (also!) fluent in English. She took me to the local police station (yes, all police stations are exactly alike) to register my residency. They didn&#39;t offer to copy the deed Garrett had passed along, so we had to go to a copy shop that also sold candy, porn, and beer. Me and Tracey got along just great, and she helped me fill out the form (I&#39;m coming to realize that the English &quot;translations&quot; on signs, placards, and forms are often just about the most abyssmal amount of effort I&#39;ve come across in an official capacity).&lt;br /&gt;After that, we returned to the office and I had a meeting with Garrett, Blake, and Tracey about the Design goals of the game and what he hoped I could help the studio accomplished. I felt very confident and excited about what I feel I&#39;m able to do, and tried to communicate this to Garrett, inbetween lessons in 13375p34k to Tracey in an attempt to subvert perhaps her English skillz.&lt;br /&gt;(I am sober now, and think I deserve a round of applause for writing all of the above tipsy).&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the day was me pretending to work, to be honest. My goals for the day were more of the social kind, like remembering everyone&#39;s names, setting up my workstation, syncing it with my desktop, playing ping pong, and figuring out the appliances in the rec room. I made a special effort in the second half of the day to meet the non-English people on the team (like my deskmate Jason and Li Hao (also known as Fox)).&lt;br /&gt;Sean invited me along with Blake and Chris to go for a walk to the local convenience store. Chris had no coat for the weather for some reason, so we had fun teasing him as we meandered to the store. Once there, Sean got Warm-Coffee-in-a-Can and Chicken Ham sticks, Blake abstained, Chris got a bit of a snack, and I got a 7-up. Chris mentioned that a building was being torn down when he came in to work, and that he wanted to see it, so we went.&lt;br /&gt;Alright: I am absolutely convinced that China has no equivalent of OSHA or labor safety regulations, since I was almost sidestepping welder sparks: the building looked like it had been bombed out, except it was full of de-construction workers. Apparantly the Army had been brought in earlier in the day to do the demolition. It was a sight to behold: men hanging over the wall-less floors chopping off the floors beneath them, hanging from rafters they were cutting off (on the wrong side, no less). It was comical. Chris said that in the UK any given spot&#39;d be violating at least a dozen regulations: I quipped that they&#39;d prolly de-construct the building 20 times faster, at least. We had a good time walking back.&lt;br /&gt;(I&#39;m really very tired: I will finish this blog in the morning.)&lt;br /&gt;Towards the end of the day, I heard that I was to go out to dinner with the bosses and my immediate coworkers, in what Chris told me was &quot;His attempt to prove that he is worthy of me, and so earn my respect&quot;. The notion struck me as odd, since we had been getting along quite well, and I didn&#39;t think any sort of prostration was required of him, but I didn&#39;t mind the gesture I suppose. And so we went out into the Shanghai night down the block past the &quot;Men&#39;s Club&quot; (I&#39;m not sure what the place is, but I imagine there are some questionable things done in there) to a third story restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;Fancy.&lt;br /&gt;We were going to sit out in an open room, but when the Uberboss came, he talked rapidly to the waiters and we were rushed to a private suite. There, we had a myriad of trays on a large lazy-susan, with only a few dishes being identifiable to me. In clockwise order, it was me, Blake, Chris, Sean, Uberboss, Eric, and Garrett. Apparantly we were being served fancy beer, but I still was kind of confused that the Budweiser I was being poured was considered &#39;fancy&#39; at all. It was fine I suppose, although I ended up having much more red wine.&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s this thing that sounds like &quot;Gang bai&quot;, and I came to learn it is verbal weaponry: you may aim it at a person and they have to match how much you drink. Being &#39;new guy&#39;, I found myself being alpha strike&#39;d by people at the table with friendly, mischievous toasts of &quot;Gang bai!&quot;. I had never seen a person have a shot of wine, but it&#39;d be a common sight directed towards me. The Uberboss made a point to do it every five minutes. I&#39;m grateful I&#39;d picked up a little bit of a tolerance from recently having an occasional beer lately, since I didn&#39;t particularly want to get silly-drunk.&lt;br /&gt;The food was great, everyone loosened up, and many embarassing stories were told. It was really very great, but I am having difficulty describing the scene, because we mostly just talked a lot and were generally merry. I walked home with Garrett, wrote a bit, and went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;This morning, I explored a little bit, cementing a mental map of my immediate neighborhood. I mostly retraced my path of yesterday, visiting Carrefour and buying a pepsi after I had gone to a convenience store and gotten bath materials (getting overcharged: I added the cost up before I went up, but neglected to look up &#39;too expensive&#39; in a phrasebook and hadn&#39;t written down my summation, so I let it slide. After all, $3 for soap, toothpaste, and a bottle of shampoo is really quite reasonable anyways, and I didn&#39;t feel particularly Ebeneezer when I woke up this morning.)&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#39;m at work, and should probably get to work.</content>

   <content type="html">Wednesday, January 13 0756&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, here I am! Quite a trip here, and have plenty to do in the day ahead: have to check in to the local police station and register myself in the afternoon, buy a cell phone (pay as you go), buy shampoo/soap/toothpaste, and have my first eat-out meal in Shanghai.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday was very very long: it was an odd mix of merging two days into one by racing the Sun to the international date line, but I&#39;m not feeling too bad of jet lag at all since I got sleep on the airplane. The airplane was for Air Canada, so all the instructions were bilingual: this was actually really very great, since that meant French was spoken and available on the little tv&#39;s in the seats. French is the only foreign language with which I have any sort of proficiency, so it was kind of like &quot;it&#39;s gonna be alright Ed: you know at least one of the foreign languages you&#39;ll meet on this trip&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I &#39;slept&#39; on the plane, and got about 5 hours worth in 30-45 minute bursts. The other 7 hours of the flight I looked out the window or ate one of the three meals they served. The most awesome sight was that of the coast of what I believe is called the Gulf of Ohstosk. Although I&#39;m unsure I spelled that correctly, I know that it is just to the west from Kamchatka. The snow draped over the endless craggy hills by the icy sea with clouds scattered below was really very breathtaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Near the end of the flight, I finally talked to my neighbour when her mother in the other aisle asked if I spoke chinese. I replied &#39;no&#39; and her daughter (I&#39;d guess roughly my age) said that she had thought so because of how good at chopsticks I was. So we chatted a bit. The guy behind us (from San Francisco, kind of a jock/party guy) interjected that Shanghai was like New York + Las Vegas and that I&#39;d die of cirrhosis once I got there. I didn&#39;t much care for him, so I just said that I was a teetotaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plane landed over the odd looking city (all the residential buildings are 14+ stories tall, but not very wide, as if they were made by one crane during their construction), and followed Daisy and her mom out to Customs. Chinese officials, whether customs officials or doormen, all looked *SO* &quot;communist&quot;: peaked caps, greatcoats, badges, pony-tail-thingies-with-piece-of-cloth on the women. It was pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I filled out my form, and waited after the line for Daisy and her Mom, who then went to the duty-free store to buy a couple cartons of Marlboro&#39;s I believe: I imagine they were going to sell them or give them to relatives, since I&#39;m pretty sure neither smoked. Daisy helped me figure out a telephone so that I could call Blake, and then directed me to the Maglev to Shanghai. I&#39;d just like to take a moment and say that I am very very grateful for the kind aid that Daisy and her mother lended to me without me even having to ask, and that if I run into them on the streets of Shanghai again, I will treat them to a nice meal: thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the 300km/h train into Shanghai. One of the things I noticed is that there is an omnipresent smell: it reminds me of a faint lingering smell of cooked noodles, sans the &#39;saltiness&#39; of the brothy smell. I imagine it is the air pollution, which is not insignificant. I&#39;ll likely get used to it, or develop asthma, *laughs*. In any case, I found Blake and Eric, who I will try to get pictures of in a later post once I get batteries for my camera(!) and they took me to Eric&#39;s place to have takeout and play XBox. The pizza must&#39;ve been a supreme, since it had all sorts of odd bits that normally aren&#39;t on pizza I usually have: there was corn, bits of ham, mushrooms, some kind of bell-pepper-y thing, accompanied with mushroom soup and a thing of lettuce greens and mashed potatos. The game was really cool (&quot;Darksiders&quot;), and we waited out the traffic jam outside. Later, they drove me to Garrett&#39;s, who is my roommate now. I&#39;ll take a picture of my room later, along with Garrett.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, everyone I&#39;ve met have been really very kind and nice, and I still have a good feeling about coming here. Shanghai is a really very odd/different city compared to what I&#39;ve visited before, and I hope to detail more of my observations later. I&#39;m also very glad I am not jet-lagged, although yesterday seemed to go on forever (from my point of view, it was a 38 hour day).</content>
