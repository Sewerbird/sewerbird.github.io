      Saribke: Human Battlemind, using glaive and speed to toss enemies tumbling back.<br />Mia: Half-Elf Warlock, blasting enemies from a range with eldritch power.<br /><br /><b>First Encounter</b><br />Our heroes are travelling along in the desert when ambushed by a cadre of kobold slingers atop a rock outcropping. In a devastating stroke, they all hammer Saribke with sling stones, bloodying him immediately. Mia reacts by blasting two of the kobolds apart with a blast, while Saribke stirs into action, charging up the outcropping in time to hobble an assailant while forcing four other kobolds to escape Saribke's arcing glaive.<br /><br />Three of the taller kobolds hurl magical slingstones against Saribke in panic to the charge, although their aim faltered. The remaining kobolds jumped into melee against him, doing significant damage. Mia runs closer, hurling blasts into the froth. Saribke, near death and furiously dismembering his assailants, jumps off the rock outcropping to Mia.<br /><br />Taking their cue, the kobolds turn attention to Mia, to disastrous effect. In response, she blasts two of the taller kobolds, and Saribke charges back in a daring effort to turn the tide. Luck on our hero's side, the kobolds are reduced to one tall kobold, which is promptly finished off by a blast from Mia. Our heroes catch their breath and heal up a bit (4 healing surges each!).<br /><br />Result: Heroes barely win. Saribke with 2 HP, Mia with 4. 13/21 healing surges left.<br /><br /><b>Second Encounter</b><br />Descending into a cave entrance found in the rock outcropping, our heroes find themselves entering a small, dark ruin. Using a sunrod from Mia's bag, a group of well equipped kobolds are revealed! Saribke leaps into action, with Mia targetting a shaman-garbed kobold further within the ruined hall. The battle is pitched but quick, with Saribke using the glaive to disperse the kobolds to gain attacks of opportunity. Mia and the shaman kobold get into a ranged spellcasting duel, with Mia using a fey blind spell to win the challenge. The battle is incredibly pitched, with the well armored kobolds using flanking attacks and the shaman using blast spells. Our heroes heal up a bit (another 8 surges used).<br /><br />Result: Heroes scrape a win. Saribke with 5 HP, Mia with 10. 7/21 healing surges left.<br /><br /><b>Third Encounter</b><br /><br />Carefully inching down into the deepest part of the ruin, our heroes run into an audience room where a young white dragon holds court over 10 kobold supplicants. Forewarned by the sounds of earlier battle, the kobolds move quickly to attack. However, Saribke is quick and dives into the fray, cutting down 3 before the kobolds pile on in a huge cluster of melee. Mia blinds one kobold that snuck behind Saribke, saving her ally's life: the kobolds do huge amounts of damage to lightly-armored Saribke, and any extra flanking surely would have been the end, since the young white dragon promptly breaths icy jets of cold into the melee, knocking Saribke to 5 HP and destroying 3 of its own kobolds. Reacting swiftly to the development, Mia lands an incredible critical hit, taking the Dragon from fresh to bloodied in a single massive stroke (32 damage!). <br /><br />Saribke deals with 2 more kobolds, and trips the dragon. The remaining 2 kobolds keep striking at Saribke, hurting him more. The dragon launches into an enraged fury, biting and clawing at Saribke, but in its haste only lands glancing scratches. Mia responds by finishing off the dragon with another great set of hits. Saribke quickly finishes off the remainding kobolds, and the halls go quiet.<br /><br />Results: Heroes win! Saribke has 6 HP, and Mia is unharmed. 200 gold is found, as well as a suit of Mithral Scale Armor +1 (for Saribke... 13 AC was waaaaay too low: 20 AC much better!). Both level up.<br /><br /><b>Analysis</b><br />Surprisingly effective duo, considering that they were only level 1 and didn't take an extended rest. The first two encounters Mia was consistently a great ranged blaster, dealing well with the stronger enemies in each encounter. However, this focus on the stronger enemies left Saribke alone to deal with the hordes of minions and fighters. With only 13 AC, there was essentially a whole set of freebie shots from minions, building up into huge amounts of damage: Saribke had 40HP, but regularly took 20~ damage after the first enemy turn. Thankfully, Saribke could reliably dish out multiple hits each round, and used a special attack heavily, shoving enemies 4 squares away. Both heroes performed quite well considering, and the Mithral Scale armor bodes well for their chances in the future. The extra cash will likely go towards buying Mia an implement to improve her attacks.
