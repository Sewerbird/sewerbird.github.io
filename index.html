  <h1>Plans to Expand the Arcade</h1>
  <p>I&#39;d like to fill up the Arcade section on my site a bit, and take a break from the more &#39;novel&#39; games I&#39;ve been trying to make in Pico8. I figure I could quickly create several small games that would be cute looking and not very time-intensive to create. It&#39;d be a spot of fun, and ideally not take more than a weekend to make a few of them. Some ideas that occur to me are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tetris</li>
<li>Minesweeper</li>
<li>Space Invaders</li>
<li>Breakout</li>
<li>Blackjack</li>
</ul>

<p>Although I&#39;ll likely default to Pico8, I&#39;m curious to try out other virtual consoles as well, particularly Tic-80. I like that Tic-80 supports more languages than just Lua (Javascript, Moonscript, and Wren pique my interest most), and has slightly more generous constraints as well as mouse support. I also find that I prefer how it full-screens on my iPhone in the browser more than Pico8: the aspect ratio is square, and the virtual buttons are a bit &#39;meh&#39; imho for the Pico8. I&#39;d prefer Pico8 for d-pad &amp; button games, but Tic-80 for mouse based games, I think.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to me that they play well on the web and on mobile devices, since that&#39;s where most of my family will encounter them, and the thing that gives me pause about Tic80 is that it seems to not have touch support for its mouse based on hubbub around the internet, but <a href="https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/wiki/Handling-Mouse-Touch-Events">this page</a> gives me hope. I&#39;ll likely tinker with it tonight.</p>

<p>In any case, I&#39;m always down to jam, whether it&#39;s music or game making.</p>
