  <h1>Things I Would Do If The Pandemic Is Over</h1>
  <p>A big goal for this year was to make legitimately intensive efforts to expand my social life here in my adopted home of Kansas City. Only boring people are bored, and I need to show to myself and others that I can live a full life without relying on the strangeness of a place like China to stimulate me. The year 2020 has been a real pain though with this pandemic, so I figured I&#39;d draft things I&#39;d like to do if the lockdowns weren&#39;t a factor and see which ones I might be able to do regardless of the current situation.</p>

<h2>Dance Classes</h2>

<p>I really enjoyed taking hip-hop dancing classes in Shanghai, and I&#39;d like to resume some form of dance again. The main thing I enjoyed, aside the extra confidence on the dance floor, was the fact that I interacted with people of an entirely different flavor than I tend to when left to my own devices.</p>

<p>The lockdown-friendliness of this is pretty iffy though: dance studios tend to be inside, and require holding/touching people.</p>

<h2>Gym</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve been doing weekend runs and a weekly telecoached workout with Toby, but I could probably kick up my fitness game a bit more. In Shanghai I used to go every weekday to workout, although I ditched the gym membership and did a home workout routine when I moved to Wuding Lu. Perhaps a group-oriented gym (like a crossfit) might be a good addition, for similar reasons as to a dance class.</p>

<p>Gyms are starting to reopen, but I imagine they&#39;ll be a bit sparse for a while yet.</p>

<h2>Jam Sessions</h2>

<p>My bass playing has gotten to the point where I can probably scrape along during a jam with other amateur musicians. If I was participating in a couple garage bands or able to attend some kind of open jam, that might be a way to meet an artistic crowd that I&#39;m lacking right now, and get some nightlife to engage in.</p>

<p>Venues are all basically closed forever, it seems, but doesn&#39;t seem impossible to jam out in the summer sun.</p>

<h2>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Games</h2>

<p>I actually already run a bi-weekly campaign for my brother and his circle, and I am a player in a weekly game at the Pawn &amp; Pint. I&#39;ve always been able to maintain pretty committed groups of people in my games though, so I could run another campaign in a different context to meet some new people regularly. It&#39;d be a bit of a commitment though.</p>

<p>I&#39;d probably run it at Pawn &amp; Pint on weekends between my current bi-weekly campaign, but it&#39;d be a significant commitment of my time.</p>

<h2>Classes</h2>

<p>I could take an art class of some kind (painting, pottery, literature...) with other people through a local school or college. They&#39;re not very high commitment, and would certainly mix me up with people outside my normal domain at the moment.</p>

<p>A lot of classes are basically cancelled or remote at the moment though, so that complicates things.</p>
