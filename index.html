  <h1>Quarantine Initiatives</h1>
  <p>The Year 2020 so far has been a... thing, to say the least. </p>

<p>What I thought was gonna be a fairly predictably political year, a re-run of 2016, has instead been a soap opera of episodic catastrophe, delivered right to your door and neighborhood. A populace already alienated in many ways from each other found itself literally isolated from each other by stay-at-home orders across the nation, sending millions to the breadline and left with nothing but their online media feeds to fuss over, like a rosary of anxiety. We see the psychic toll, as people feel anger, despair, dazedness, and paralysis. I think those emotions were already a bit high before 2020, but they&#39;re now boiled sufficiently to be a force to be reckoned with, and I&#39;ll likely talk about it in the coming months more.</p>

<p>But! I made a promise to myself in Shanghai that I would return to America and ardently make it my home, and to lend my hand to its reinvigoration: to make America greater. Finding myself in a position of strength as these calamities hit, I&#39;ve resolved to do my best to keep my corner of America strong. I&#39;ve seen many other people do similar and greater things, and I think the merit of these actions are worth recording. Here has been my part:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#39;ve tried to be lender of first-resort to friends and family: the $1200 from the government was taking too long.</li>
<li>I helped facilitate a supply line of N95 Respirators to the US from China by asking my network of friends and colleagues there. Those masks helped my family and many doctors and nurses</li>
<li>I&#39;ve rekindled friendships with old friends on the internet using video conferencing. These span states, and is a small means of improving the interknittedness of all of us.</li>
<li>I&#39;ve started inviting my next door neighbors on walks on the local nature trail. If they find themselves in urgent need, perhaps now they&#39;ll feel more comfortable knocking on my door now.</li>
<li>When a business I support reopens, I try to go there twice as often as I used to: I have plenty of time, and want to help them out.</li>
<li>I check in on people whose job situation has been affected, and keep an ear to the ground for alternative opportunities for them.</li>
<li>I have been focusing intensively on learning the Bass guitar and following a strict diet to lose weight, so that I can feel more confident talking to strangers by having something to talk about and model personal growth. If I&#39;m lucky, maybe someone will be inspired to feel they can do the same.</li>
<li>I make a targetted effort to be an effective cheerleader for my team, and hang out in the shared video chat all day. This makes my workplace feel more &#39;normal&#39;, and keep the wheels rolling even if it&#39;d be easier to self-isolate while coding.</li>
</ul>

<p>I regret not having started my training towards getting certified as an Emergency Medical Technician. I was about to pull the trigger on it at the local community college right when the pandemic hit and everything shut down. I could&#39;ve drafted myself to bring folks to the hospital as needed.</p>

<p>I also regret that I hadn&#39;t taken as seriously as I should&#39;ve the imperative to broaden my network of friends. I have a free capacity to help, but I know so few people well enough to know their needs. I want to be someone who is more knowledgeable and available to people&#39;s suffering.</p>

<p>Selfishly, I&#39;ve been largely spared from much pain: my job is simply at home now, and my income is unthreatened. I&#39;ve gotten to focus on self-mastery, and so I&#39;ll likely come out of all of this stronger and more vibrant than before. I&#39;ll continue to owe it to others to give a helping hand.</p>

<p>Anyways, that&#39;s what&#39;s been going on in my zone. Take care out there.</p>
