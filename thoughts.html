  <h1>Thoughts</h1>

<p>I keep my personal twitter here. These are fired off by a one-liner in my terminal!</p>

<ul>

  <li>
  (Today): The only thing harder than meeting new people here is meeting those people again 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Yesterday): Just passed the Mun in Kerbal Space Program. It has been a long while since I've played, so getting used to the new aerodynamics is taking some effort! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Last Saturday): Did a ton of chores today, with the general aim of getting my wardrobe reset. It's draining to do, but pays dividends in presenting yourself to others. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Last Saturday): Busy day ahead: helping out brother, going clothes shopping, going grocery shopping, and then hosting a D&D night at my house! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Last Thursday): I'm very lucky that my friend was learning how to mix drinks last evening, but the sugar in them was not good for my ketosis. Worth it though! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Last Wednesday): Currently attending a D&D session on Roll20, while myself at Pawn and Pint. Wild! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Last Wednesday): Looking forward to a picnic at lunch today with my coworkers: been a bit too long since face-to-face. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Last Wednesday): Pawn and Pint last night was great: I played Magic for the first time in almost ten years with some new folks. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Last Tuesday): I'm excited to go visit Pawn & Pint for the first time since the pandemic 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Last Tuesday): I believe there is a threshold of media consumption past which one becomes less and less accurately informed about the world. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Last Tuesday): I'm not very good at gardening in pots, but I've not killed any plants yet so I'll count that as a win 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Last Monday): Storm clouds rolling in it looks like: some rain to relieve how hot the past few days have been! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Last Monday): Autopushing commits to master when making a thought feels exciting, but that's because it makes me uneasy, lol. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Last Monday): First thought from work 
  </li>

  <li>
  (7 June 2020): I'm glad to start working out again, but definitely taking it down a notch next time. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (7 June 2020): Way too short of a weekend: my legs are still hurting from Wednesday. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (7 June 2020): Settling down to relax the last few hours of the weekend. Pretty productive weekend! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (7 June 2020): Site is finally looking presentable. Still is only offline though, and I'd like to write up a blog post for its debut first. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (7 June 2020): Got a songbook for the stand: should help my sight reading, which I'm frankly terrible at. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (7 June 2020): Sakura.css is probably how I'll go for styling on the site. Futzing around with the nav at the moment. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (6 June 2020): Its humid and warm today: reminds me of Shanghai. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (5 June 2020): Optimistic for my brother as he makes big changes in his life. Very proud! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (5 June 2020): Had a memorable experience at the BLM demonstration downtown yesterday. Also, the anarchists with the tent are always the coolest. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (4 June 2020): Exercise with Toby yesterday kicked my ass: my legs are so sore it hurts to sit! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (2 June 2020): I added an extra half pint of half cream to the masala. Predictably awesome! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (31 May 2020): Such a nice day outside. I've been taking turns writing this site up, playing bass, talking to people online, and taking nature walks. Gonna be refreshed tomorrow 
  </li>

  <li>
  (31 May 2020): Covet's 'Falkor' is great on loop. Fun background while watching the Dragon Capsule board the ISS! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (30 May 2020): I can't believe SpaceX just successfully inserted men into orbit 
  </li>

  <li>
  (30 May 2020): I wonder what the day before looks like for someone who riots through the night. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (29 May 2020): A thought made via an ERB template 
  </li>
