  <h1>Thoughts</h1>

<p>I keep my personal twitter here. These are fired off by a one-liner in my terminal!</p>

<ul>

  <li>
  (Today): Been bedeviled by indigestion the past few days. Really cutting into my sleep :-( 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Last Wednesday): People are always pretty surprising if you can get them to talk about themselves: met a voice actor today! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Last Tuesday): The consistency of my days this year (same place, same schedule) highlights to me the fact that human energy really is subject to an ebb and flow tied more to the spirit than real stimulus. Today I'm feeling a bit thin-spirited. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Last Monday): My master todo file has gotten so long its breaking the highlighting of my editor. One file for almost 5 years of daily activities! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Last Sunday): What a nice day out. Going to enjoy brunch at P&P, then hang out with my Mom and Brother over a backyard bratwurst 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Last Saturday): Just had a great time hosting my D&D group at my house for the first time since the lockdowns. They delved; they looted; they got trapped! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Last Saturday): Unfortunately, TIC-80 doesn't have very good capabilites on touch-based mobile devices: Pico8's gamepad overlay seems to be better paradigm for now. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (19 June 2020): I heard the term 'critical feeling' for the first time yesterday, and the concept's grown on me quite a bit. It draws a parallel to 'critical thinking', where you source and try to understand your emotions, to gain maturity in heart, as opposed to mind. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (17 June 2020): Wednesdays are fast becoming my favorite day of the week: work is usually smooth, I get a workout with my best friend from college, and I get to go to my favorite bar to hang out with cool people over a drink or game of D&D 
  </li>

  <li>
  (16 June 2020): Yarrow sticks are cool and all, but I prefer `puts %w[☰ ☱ ☲ ☳ ☴ ☵ ☶ ☷ ].sample(2)` 
  </li>

  <li>
  (16 June 2020): The hardest bad mood to shake is when it's caused by vague threats to your self-development and well-being that you can't control 
  </li>

  <li>
  (15 June 2020): The only thing harder than meeting new people here is meeting those people again 
  </li>

  <li>
  (14 June 2020): Just passed the Mun in Kerbal Space Program. It has been a long while since I've played, so getting used to the new aerodynamics is taking some effort! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (13 June 2020): Did a ton of chores today, with the general aim of getting my wardrobe reset. It's draining to do, but pays dividends in presenting yourself to others. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (13 June 2020): Busy day ahead: helping out brother, going clothes shopping, going grocery shopping, and then hosting a D&D night at my house! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (11 June 2020): I'm very lucky that my friend was learning how to mix drinks last evening, but the sugar in them was not good for my ketosis. Worth it though! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (10 June 2020): Currently attending a D&D session on Roll20, while myself at Pawn and Pint. Wild! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (10 June 2020): Looking forward to a picnic at lunch today with my coworkers: been a bit too long since face-to-face. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (10 June 2020): Pawn and Pint last night was great: I played Magic for the first time in almost ten years with some new folks. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (9 June 2020): I'm excited to go visit Pawn & Pint for the first time since the pandemic 
  </li>

  <li>
  (9 June 2020): I believe there is a threshold of media consumption past which one becomes less and less accurately informed about the world. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (9 June 2020): I'm not very good at gardening in pots, but I've not killed any plants yet so I'll count that as a win 
  </li>

  <li>
  (8 June 2020): Storm clouds rolling in it looks like: some rain to relieve how hot the past few days have been! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (8 June 2020): Autopushing commits to master when making a thought feels exciting, but that's because it makes me uneasy, lol. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (8 June 2020): First thought from work 
  </li>

  <li>
  (7 June 2020): I'm glad to start working out again, but definitely taking it down a notch next time. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (7 June 2020): Way too short of a weekend: my legs are still hurting from Wednesday. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (7 June 2020): Settling down to relax the last few hours of the weekend. Pretty productive weekend! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (7 June 2020): Site is finally looking presentable. Still is only offline though, and I'd like to write up a blog post for its debut first. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (7 June 2020): Got a songbook for the stand: should help my sight reading, which I'm frankly terrible at. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (7 June 2020): Sakura.css is probably how I'll go for styling on the site. Futzing around with the nav at the moment. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (6 June 2020): Its humid and warm today: reminds me of Shanghai. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (5 June 2020): Optimistic for my brother as he makes big changes in his life. Very proud! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (5 June 2020): Had a memorable experience at the BLM demonstration downtown yesterday. Also, the anarchists with the tent are always the coolest. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (4 June 2020): Exercise with Toby yesterday kicked my ass: my legs are so sore it hurts to sit! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (2 June 2020): I added an extra half pint of half cream to the masala. Predictably awesome! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (31 May 2020): Such a nice day outside. I've been taking turns writing this site up, playing bass, talking to people online, and taking nature walks. Gonna be refreshed tomorrow 
  </li>

  <li>
  (31 May 2020): Covet's 'Falkor' is great on loop. Fun background while watching the Dragon Capsule board the ISS! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (30 May 2020): I can't believe SpaceX just successfully inserted men into orbit 
  </li>

  <li>
  (30 May 2020): I wonder what the day before looks like for someone who riots through the night. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (29 May 2020): A thought made via an ERB template 
  </li>
