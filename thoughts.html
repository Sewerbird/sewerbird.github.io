  <h1>Thoughts</h1>

<p>I keep my personal twitter here. These are fired off by a one-liner in my terminal!</p>

<ul>

  <li>
  (Today): Storm clouds rolling in it looks like: some rain to relieve how hot the past few days have been! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Today): Autopushing commits to master when making a thought feels exciting, but that's because it makes me uneasy, lol. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Today): First thought from work 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Yesterday): I'm glad to start working out again, but definitely taking it down a notch next time. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Yesterday): Way too short of a weekend: my legs are still hurting from Wednesday. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Yesterday): Settling down to relax the last few hours of the weekend. Pretty productive weekend! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Yesterday): Site is finally looking presentable. Still is only offline though, and I'd like to write up a blog post for its debut first. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Yesterday): Got a songbook for the stand: should help my sight reading, which I'm frankly terrible at. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Yesterday): Sakura.css is probably how I'll go for styling on the site. Futzing around with the nav at the moment. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Last Saturday): Its humid and warm today: reminds me of Shanghai. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Last Friday): Optimistic for my brother as he makes big changes in his life. Very proud! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Last Friday): Had a memorable experience at the BLM demonstration downtown yesterday. Also, the anarchists with the tent are always the coolest. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Last Thursday): Exercise with Toby yesterday kicked my ass: my legs are so sore it hurts to sit! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (Last Tuesday): I added an extra half pint of half cream to the masala. Predictably awesome! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (31 May 2020): Such a nice day outside. I've been taking turns writing this site up, playing bass, talking to people online, and taking nature walks. Gonna be refreshed tomorrow 
  </li>

  <li>
  (31 May 2020): Covet's 'Falkor' is great on loop. Fun background while watching the Dragon Capsule board the ISS! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (30 May 2020): I can't believe SpaceX just successfully inserted men into orbit 
  </li>

  <li>
  (30 May 2020): I wonder what the day before looks like for someone who riots through the night. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (29 May 2020): A thought made via an ERB template 
  </li>
