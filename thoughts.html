  <h1>Thoughts</h1>

<p>I keep my personal twitter here. These are fired off by a one-liner in my terminal!</p>

<ul>

  <li>
  (Today): Resuming my blues jamming this evening. The bar got closed due to Covid for a minute 
  </li>

  <li>
  (11 August 2020): Just as the distinction between the 'silent' and 'boomer' generation is only brought out when convenient, I think 'Xers' are starting to find themselves lumped in with the 'boomers' now. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (11 August 2020): Definitely fishing around for a second serious hobby: leaning on the bass a bit overmuch, some small risk of burnout 
  </li>

  <li>
  (5 August 2020): Going out to places and putting yourself out there is probably the fundamental civic duty - and I don't think being on the internet counts 
  </li>

  <li>
  (4 August 2020): Maj6 is a very handsome chord over the 12-bar blues 
  </li>

  <li>
  (3 August 2020): 'Finally', the best way to fight evil is to make energetic progress in the good. - I Ching 
  </li>

  <li>
  (1 August 2020): Taking care of my potted balcony plants is like managing an intensive care unit 
  </li>

  <li>
  (30 July 2020): So rainy this week. I didn't mind the heat and sun, hope it comes back this weekend 
  </li>

  <li>
  (29 July 2020): Been reading Slaughterhouse Five, about halfway through. I like it, but I loved Cat's Cradle. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (28 July 2020): Another jam tonight - hafta admit I feel a bit dull heading into it, hope I perk up 
  </li>

  <li>
  (27 July 2020): Bought an acoustic bass guitar - was great to be able to play in the park this weekend! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (21 July 2020): Just finished my first every live performance! Wasn't terribad, but looking forward to improving next week ;-) 
  </li>

  <li>
  (19 July 2020): I practiced so much 12-bar shuffle today. Really aiming to be passably good for the live jam on Tuesday 
  </li>

  <li>
  (18 July 2020): Was on a roof most of this morning: gets hot out there 0_o 
  </li>

  <li>
  (11 July 2020): Ran for an hour today: it's hot out there! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (10 July 2020): I'm going to check out the night scene near 75th and see what's open tonight. After all that has happened, it's a valid question to ask: 'Where is Waldo' :-P 
  </li>

  <li>
  (9 July 2020): Brainstorming how to be social during a pandemic is a bit like figuring out what you can create with an egg and a piece of string 
  </li>

  <li>
  (8 July 2020): Feeling a bit nervous about today: gotta keep a positive mindset! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (5 July 2020): Just finished an hour laying out in a grassy field working on my tan. Sure a lovely day! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (4 July 2020): I worry about how effective phones are at being a portal away from the here-and-now: it's a k-hole of attention. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (3 July 2020): A day off! Got a blog post done and now gonna do some chores and finalize some plans for the weekend 
  </li>

  <li>
  (2 July 2020): I wish I could turn off the overthinker in me sometimes: it inevitably has the same conclusion as my gut feeling, but spends a lot more time doing so 
  </li>

  <li>
  (1 July 2020): Colonel just made a slinky escape from my house when I left the front door barely unlatched. Took a second to find him and bring him back! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (30 June 2020): Woke up in a great mood today: ready to tackle the world! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (27 June 2020): Been bedeviled by indigestion the past few days. Really cutting into my sleep :-( 
  </li>

  <li>
  (24 June 2020): People are always pretty surprising if you can get them to talk about themselves: met a voice actor today! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (23 June 2020): The consistency of my days this year (same place, same schedule) highlights to me the fact that human energy really is subject to an ebb and flow tied more to the spirit than real stimulus. Today I'm feeling a bit thin-spirited. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (22 June 2020): My master todo file has gotten so long its breaking the highlighting of my editor. One file for almost 5 years of daily activities! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (21 June 2020): What a nice day out. Going to enjoy brunch at P&P, then hang out with my Mom and Brother over a backyard bratwurst 
  </li>

  <li>
  (20 June 2020): Just had a great time hosting my D&D group at my house for the first time since the lockdowns. They delved; they looted; they got trapped! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (20 June 2020): Unfortunately, TIC-80 doesn't have very good capabilites on touch-based mobile devices: Pico8's gamepad overlay seems to be better paradigm for now. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (19 June 2020): I heard the term 'critical feeling' for the first time yesterday, and the concept's grown on me quite a bit. It draws a parallel to 'critical thinking', where you source and try to understand your emotions, to gain maturity in heart, as opposed to mind. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (17 June 2020): Wednesdays are fast becoming my favorite day of the week: work is usually smooth, I get a workout with my best friend from college, and I get to go to my favorite bar to hang out with cool people over a drink or game of D&D 
  </li>

  <li>
  (16 June 2020): Yarrow sticks are cool and all, but I prefer `puts %w[☰ ☱ ☲ ☳ ☴ ☵ ☶ ☷ ].sample(2)` 
  </li>

  <li>
  (16 June 2020): The hardest bad mood to shake is when it's caused by vague threats to your self-development and well-being that you can't control 
  </li>

  <li>
  (15 June 2020): The only thing harder than meeting new people here is meeting those people again 
  </li>

  <li>
  (14 June 2020): Just passed the Mun in Kerbal Space Program. It has been a long while since I've played, so getting used to the new aerodynamics is taking some effort! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (13 June 2020): Did a ton of chores today, with the general aim of getting my wardrobe reset. It's draining to do, but pays dividends in presenting yourself to others. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (13 June 2020): Busy day ahead: helping out brother, going clothes shopping, going grocery shopping, and then hosting a D&D night at my house! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (11 June 2020): I'm very lucky that my friend was learning how to mix drinks last evening, but the sugar in them was not good for my ketosis. Worth it though! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (10 June 2020): Currently attending a D&D session on Roll20, while myself at Pawn and Pint. Wild! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (10 June 2020): Looking forward to a picnic at lunch today with my coworkers: been a bit too long since face-to-face. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (10 June 2020): Pawn and Pint last night was great: I played Magic for the first time in almost ten years with some new folks. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (9 June 2020): I'm excited to go visit Pawn & Pint for the first time since the pandemic 
  </li>

  <li>
  (9 June 2020): I believe there is a threshold of media consumption past which one becomes less and less accurately informed about the world. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (9 June 2020): I'm not very good at gardening in pots, but I've not killed any plants yet so I'll count that as a win 
  </li>

  <li>
  (8 June 2020): Storm clouds rolling in it looks like: some rain to relieve how hot the past few days have been! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (8 June 2020): Autopushing commits to master when making a thought feels exciting, but that's because it makes me uneasy, lol. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (8 June 2020): First thought from work 
  </li>

  <li>
  (7 June 2020): I'm glad to start working out again, but definitely taking it down a notch next time. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (7 June 2020): Way too short of a weekend: my legs are still hurting from Wednesday. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (7 June 2020): Settling down to relax the last few hours of the weekend. Pretty productive weekend! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (7 June 2020): Site is finally looking presentable. Still is only offline though, and I'd like to write up a blog post for its debut first. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (7 June 2020): Got a songbook for the stand: should help my sight reading, which I'm frankly terrible at. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (7 June 2020): Sakura.css is probably how I'll go for styling on the site. Futzing around with the nav at the moment. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (6 June 2020): Its humid and warm today: reminds me of Shanghai. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (5 June 2020): Optimistic for my brother as he makes big changes in his life. Very proud! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (5 June 2020): Had a memorable experience at the BLM demonstration downtown yesterday. Also, the anarchists with the tent are always the coolest. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (4 June 2020): Exercise with Toby yesterday kicked my ass: my legs are so sore it hurts to sit! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (2 June 2020): I added an extra half pint of half cream to the masala. Predictably awesome! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (31 May 2020): Such a nice day outside. I've been taking turns writing this site up, playing bass, talking to people online, and taking nature walks. Gonna be refreshed tomorrow 
  </li>

  <li>
  (31 May 2020): Covet's 'Falkor' is great on loop. Fun background while watching the Dragon Capsule board the ISS! 
  </li>

  <li>
  (30 May 2020): I can't believe SpaceX just successfully inserted men into orbit 
  </li>

  <li>
  (30 May 2020): I wonder what the day before looks like for someone who riots through the night. 
  </li>

  <li>
  (29 May 2020): A thought made via an ERB template 
  </li>
