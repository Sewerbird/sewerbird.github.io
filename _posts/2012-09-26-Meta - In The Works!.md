Over the past several days, I've been busy with personal business, so have not been able to focus on posting new content. However, this past weekend I <strong>did </strong>finish the bulk of the short solo playtest adventure, and what remains is to create pre-generated characters, run through the adventure myself, and prettying the document up. Depending on how long this takes, it will either be tomorrow's post or saved for the weekend.

I'm looking forward to sharing the little adventure I wrote, and it has definitely provided some insights into changes I think I need to make to my system already. I'll make sure to post a transcript of a playthrough at some point!
