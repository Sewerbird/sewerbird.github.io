A small but highly visible population of Sakire are born with no pupils in their eyes, and are thus completely blind. These individuals are said to be chosen by the gods to enact the will of the precursor civilization, and this could very well be true, for such a child is invariably gifted with magical abilities: these gifted individuals are called Psykers.This supernatural ability manifests primarily as an ability to perform feats of divination and psychic attacks.

You may choose the Psyker as your character's Birth background. If you do so, you gain the special Psyker attribute at rank 1. This attribute is used whenever you try to overcome an obstacle using your talent for telekinesis and noticing the hidden energies of your environment. You are also born blind: you are unable by any means to gain the sense of sight. You may take Senses rolls at normal, except you suffer difficulty equivalent to being in utter darkness.

Psykers have access to several specialist schools which can serve to broaden your abilities, but each Psyker starts with two innate abilities. The first is telekinesis, which allows you to affect inanimate objects as if you were located adjacent to them. This ability has a range of approximately 20 feet, and requires line of sight. Using this power, you can do things like pull a lever, pick up a knife from a distant table
