To start the story, I choose an initial goal that explains why Semsa is the focus of an adventure. I decide that he has been charged with finding a village girl who has been kidnapped by bandits, and he has found their hideout in a mazeway. I decide to begin play on a balcony overlooking their base.

<span style="color: #00ffff;">"Is there an easy way down to their base?"</span> <span style="color: #00ff00;">Inquire = 5 (Yes).</span>

The balcony is actually a landing on an exterior staircase on the side of a tall building next to the bandit's abode. The staircase terminates right at a side door to the hideout.

"I try to sneak down the stairs, keeping an eye out for any visible bandits. How does that go?" I roll 4, and figure the task is fairly easy (+2 DC), so I roll Senses vs. 6: I get a 6, just barely succeeding.

Semsa cautiously slips his way down to the stairway's bottom, rushes to the side door, crouches, and places his ear to the door, rifle drawn.

<span style="color: #00ffff;">"Do I hear anything on the other side of the door?"</span> <span style="color: #00ff00;">Inquire = 4 (Yes, but).</span>

Through the frosted glass door Semsa hears nothing except for a quiet purr of some kind. Semsa decides to crack open the door and continue. The room appears to be a pantry of some sort, a large table in the middle.

<span style="color: #00ffff;">"Is there a sleeping golem watchdog under the table?"</span><span style="color: #00ff00;"> Inquire = 6 (Yes, and).</span>

Underneath the table is a lean golem, who appears to be waking up: the orange activation lights running in a line down its neck are turning red at Semsa's presence as it stands to its legs!

I choose the "Generic Agile Small Golem" profile: Body 4, Senses 3, Mind 0, Social 0 with Climbing, Fighting Intruders (5 damage), and Surviving Surprises. HP 20, no wounds.

Semsa, startled by the golem, brings his rifle up and shoots (Senses vs Body), using both of his actions for his turns. He rolls 8, one more than the golem's reaction of 7(4 from body, 3 from defending). The slug pounds through the golem's side, doing 10 HP damage.

The golem pounces (a move), serratted metal claws reaching out (Body vs Senses attack) to end Semsa's day. The attack rolls a 8 against Semsa's 7, meaning Semsa is tackled by the ferocious monster, taking 5 HP damage.

Scared and unable to fire the weapon at the golem, Semsa tries to figure out how best to kick off the golem. (Inquire action)

<span style="color: #00ffff;">"Is Semsa able to use his rifle to help defend himself?"</span> <span style="color: #00ff00;">Inquire = 5 (Yes).</span>

Semsa uses his second action to fend off the golem by butting the rifle against it while trying to scuttle away (Move action, Body vs. Body check). Semsa rolls 7 vs 7, narrowly able to Disengage from the golem.

The golem leaps, Semsa once again Engaged (due to the previous Disengage, however, this took up both of the golem's actions). Semsa tries to brawl with the golem, rolling 8 on both of his attacks, relentlessly tearing at the golem's wires and sensory equipment (4 HP damage each). The golem is low on HP, but fights just as ferociously as when it started: it succeeds in two attacks, doing another 5 HP each.Semsa opts to take a wound instead of one of the damages, bringing him down to two wounds and 2 HP!

Fighting for his life, Semsa puts both his hands on the golem's head and does two quick snapping motions (two Body vs. Body attacks). The first snap does nothing, but the second severs the metallic vertebrae, doing 4 HP damage, enough to disable the golem!

Semsa curses himself for not bringing a close combat weapon, cradling his badly damaged arm. The shot from his gun must have alerted the bandits in the home, and Semsa levels his Kakisme toward the inner door on the other side of the room...

<span style="color: #00ffff;">"Does Semsa have time to catch his breath before the kidnappers come (if they chose to)?"</span> <span style="color: #00ff00;">Inquire = 5 (Yes).</span>

...taking a deep breath and focusing on the task at hand (HP restored, wound remains). A little girl needs to be saved, and he's here to do so no matter what! Semsa quickly tries to figure out the next step, and slowly approaches the door with gun ready to blast.

"Are the Kidnappers waiting on the other side of the door ready to take him down?"

Find out next time :)
