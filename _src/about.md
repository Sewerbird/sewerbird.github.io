# About

## ...Me

My name is Edward, and I spend most of my time working on hobbies: I have an interest in coding, games (video and physical), linguistics, and bass guitar.

You can contact me at [my email](mailto: sewerbird@gmail.com).

## ...This Site

This site is handcrafted: I have written all the markup, and it is statically-generated using a script I wrote. I use [sakura.css](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura) for styling, since my talents are not in design, and it is a classless framework that will work with my semantic html effortlessly.


## ...Respect for You

This site respects your privacy and your needs as a browser:

- This site does not rely on javascript for any necessary functionality: only for javascript games in the Arcade section.
- This site uses semantic html and alt tags, making life easier for screen readers
- This site does not use analytics or other forms of tracking, other than whatever my web hosting provider might do without my knowledge
