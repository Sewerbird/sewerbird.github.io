# Arcade

I make games periodically in game jams. When they are ready to share, I'll put those playable in a browser here.

## Rocketboy

This originally was an iOS game I made with my friend Sean when I lived in Boston. Although its slot in the app store has lapsed since then, I re-made it in Love2D over a weekend when I stumbled upon its art assets zipped up in an old email.

## Trader of the Fading Suns

This is a game I made for the Pico-8 virtual console to learn the ropes. It's a very rudimentary trading simulator where you have a spaceship and wander the galaxy buying high and selling low to have enough money to retire. It's a weird tribute to the old game Emperor of the Fading Suns, where you are a League trader.
