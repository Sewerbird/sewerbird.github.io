These are my public notes for the events of the fourth session. They are provided to record what happened for posterity, and for reference of the players.

## TL;DR

Infiltrating Carp's house with Frond, Yunni finds evidence linking Carp to a conspiracy of Viola and Margareta to murder Chief Winter. The party retrieves the hidden lockbox from Viola's Longmen. A trial is held that erupts into chaos as Viola's defense of Margareta falls apart under the party's evidence.

## Session 4: The Conspiracy Unmasked

The session begins with a flashback to Yunni meeting with Willow at dusk, contemporaneous with Striking Panther and Kosumi visiting Viola. Behind the house, she finds Willow accompanied by a man named Frond, who is a bit simple. With Frond, Yunni enter Carp's house to find the wives and their children drugged fast asleep in the back room. Shuffling through the room, Yunni finds a tablet covered in Taboo cuneiform behind a crate. Frond takes Yunni upstairs to the loft, where they find more storage. Beyond the storage, however, is a secret room with two cabinets and a desk. On the desk is a clay tablet with a note to Carp from Viola that implies that Margareta murdered Chief Winter at her behest for his benefit. Further, Yunni finds the copper dagger of Chief Winter amongst a display of scalps.

As this happens, though, downstairs Stone arrives to awake Carp's wives and children due to a commotion. Yunni and Frond hide deep in the attic, and keep deathly quiet as they hear Carp arrive downstairs as well. Carp storms up to the attic, and Frond parts the roof's thatch for the two to make an escape. Her perfectly puts the roof back in place as Yunni dives off the roof, and the two escape into the night to find the Erikander, who has rushed to intervene against Striking Panther's murder at the hands of Margareta.

The erikander is invited to house arrest, and carry the lockbox from Margareta's house back to their hut. Broken Arrow informs the party of the nature of this lead-lined box, that it contains a radioactive bad juju that could potentially explain the strange sickness the town has: not only has Margareta killed Chief Winter in conspiracy with Viola and Carp, but they might be responsible for sickening the populace! All of this will have to be carefully revealed in the morning, because the trial will be held at first light.

In the morning, Ambrosia did a dance to help consecreate the trial ground, and Viola & Margareta took the defense, with the Erikander's prosecution led by Ashemere, a tribal advocate. Hand and Shawm served as Judge and Bailiff, and ruled over the proceedings. Viola argued that Margareta acted in self defense against Striking Panther, who had just the day before held a knife to her neck without due cause. This was pretty persuasive, but the Erikander brought charges of conspiracy to murder Chief Winter, and started burying the defense in evidence for the crimes, justifying Striking Panther's investigation. Viola tried to tell a story of Chief Winter having poisoned the tribe with taboo, and that he had to be removed along with his evil box, but the judge wasn't persuaded by this line of reasoning, especially once Viola started to cast blame over on Carp, blurting out about an affair she was having with him.

With the plot unmasked, and the defense falling apart, Viola began to summon the Longmen to her defense, with Hand leaping into action with a spear against her. At this, the courtroom erupted into a melee, with everyone choosing sides in the heat of the moment to come to the defense of alternatively Viola, Carp, the Erikander, or Willow.
