These are my public notes for the events of the first session. They are provided to record what happened for posterity, and for reference of the players.

## TL;DR

The party successfully reached the camp of the Bluecane Tribe in Kicabyu, learned of the Chieftain's death, and partook in his funeral feast.

## Session 1: Arriving at the Bluecane Camp

The Erikander started the session on their canoe off the shore of Kicabyu, on their way to help the Bluecane tribe. Striking Panther spotted a Dire Orca, who turned to attack the party. Mercy Sharpbow deftly helmed the vessel with everyone rowing hard to the shore. After several bumps and harassment, they made it safely to shore and waited for the orcas to leave.

After a while, the Erikander followed the shore in the canoe to the mouth of a river with a Kicabi totem: a landmark to find the Bluecane tribe. Pacha Groundbreaker and Broken Arrow assessed that the immediate area was safe, and then the party rowed up the river until the late evening. With the dark pines looming overhead, the group hid the canoe and huddled into a small camp.

In the morning, after a short trek, they encountered a Longman, his skeletal eye sockets illuminated by a faint green glow. "You approach the spring camp of the Bluecane tribe, led by Chief Winter. This th-th-thrall is controlled by Viola, his necromancer". After stating that the group was an Erikander sent to help, the skeletal guard guided them to the edge of the Bluecane's encampment by the river.

Reaching the village, dozens of children swarmed the Erikander, many of them looking malnourished and sick. This wasn't enough to stop them from being excited to meet outsiders. The throng followed them to the main longhouse, where a meeting with the most important tribesmen of the Bluecanes.

There, the Erikander learned about the chief's death a week ago, and that there will be a funeral for him that evening. Further, an election for the next chief will follow in three days between Carp, the right-hand man of Chief Winter and Willow, Chief Winter's eldest teenage son. The council hopes the Erikander will help find the cure to the wasting sickness afflicting the community.

The party then went about town investigating the sickness, and making sure the funeral was safe. Concerns about food poisoning, fungal growth, and rotten food were investigated before the feast of the evening, with nothing in particular showing up as very suspect. Viola was seen talking to Margareta the Bonesinger privately by Striking Panther and Mercy Sharpbow. Yunni interviewed Willow to assess his character. Hispeth the Bluecane druid helped describe the current state of the tribe briefly before the feast, but couldn't be caught alone from the ears of most of the tribe.

The evening ended with the flesh of the chief being served in a brain stew at a bonfire commemorating his passing, and the tribe danced and honored him until late into the evening.
