Today I present a bird's eye view of the region of Kyahida, with a map and descriptions of some locales in the region

## Overview

The Nenth is a moon a little bit (80%) smaller than Earth, and orbits around Rael. Rael is a gas giant in the habitable zone of the host star, and is a bit smaller than Neptune in our own solar system. Rael is a sleepy giant, not prone to the great storms of Jupiter: its face is only faintly featured, a fluffy blue-white giant with oceans of sky.

If we zoom in on the moon, we note that the Nenth has oceans of its own: most of it lies underwater, with only a cap of land around the north pole poking up through the ocean. Here is a map of the Nenth projected onto a map of Earth for comparison of latitudes and landmass shape:

As you can see, the whole of the land is about the size of Africa, when you take into consideration the smaller radius of the Nenth, planted firmly on the pole. Although green on this map, the vast bulk of this land is an icy rocky wasteland, only giving away to conifer forests and tundra near its southernmost coast. This northern expanse is named 'Esoenska' in the tongue of the Sakire, and is a land unexplored and avoided for its inhospitable climate. A lack of mountain ranges in the extreme north of the Nenth means freezing driving winds race towards the sea, leaving (at most) a windswept land of rock and lichen living marginally in their wind-shade. The Great Southern Ocean throws its own warm wind north to fight the polar cold, and harbors grand hurricanes that meander around the equator.

However, not all of the Nenth is open ocean, and not all of the Nenth is the frigid barren of Esoenska. Attached to Esoenska, jutting south to the equator like a cautious hand, is the land of Kyahida. On the map above, it is situated right near the Caspian Sea. Where North and South meet, we meet the land of our interest:

## Kyahida and its Environs

The inspiration for Kyahida's terrain comes from the Pacific Northwest and Alaska: islands and sounds have been carved out of the coast by glaciers and tectonic activity. The waters teem with fish and the rocky shores are bespeckled with clams, oysters, and barnacles. Tall conifers carpet the steep slopes leading up from the water and mist clings to them in the morning until the midday sun half-heartedly burns the clouds away.

There are three main bodies of water that concern the Sakire and form the primary source of food, transport, and commerce. *The Hyalisam* is a  deep sound connected to the ocean, stretching 300 kilometers from its mouth at Ladibel to its stomach at Kicabel. The Hyalisam is the 'Mediterranean' of Kyahida, serving as the cradle of Sakire civilization much as the Mediterranean was for the West.

Just inland is the *Nakaija*, a rift lake stretching from Ricabel to the food of Mount Kyo-Sara. Its shores are famous for their red fronds, the stunning view of the mountains, and mischievous hill people bedevilling Nakibeli citizens. Taking the Nakaija to its most remote bay places you at the Pact Gate, an isthmus leading to a gulf beyond its steep ridge.

This gulf is called the *Sea of Two Coasts*, at whose base Serabel sits. Although a literal backwater, so far as most Kyahidans are concerned, the thousand islands of the Sea's archipelago are a beautiful sight, with warm comfortable beaches as you get to the southernmost isles.

Turning our attention from water to the land, there is a collection of mountain ranges that are resulting from tectonic plate motion: the waters flood the valleys of the uplifted peaks. The Primary ranges are the Sansari Range, Golem's Reach, Lord Damerun Range, and the range lifting up the stratovolcano Mt. Kyo-Sara up from the sea.

The *Sansari Range* is the most modest of the mountain ranges, and includes the Free Hills that form the eastern limit of the watershed of the River Jezzali.

Sat opposite, however, lies *Golem's Reach* - an incredibly rugged peninsula forming the western coast of the Hyalisam, and is home to deadly, eponymous Golems. These golems suffer no Sakire to live within their territory.

Golem's Reach falls into the ocean only barely before it would run into'*Lord Damerun Range*. This second land is the stony root of an archipelago stretching over a thousand kilometers. Its northern slopses give way to The Nakaija and the isthmus of Ricabel.

Finally, but perhaps most majestically is *Mount Kyo-Sara*. This enormous volcano is visible on a clear day from anywhere in Kyahida, presiding powerfully over the Nakaija. Thankfully, it hasn't erupted in hundreds of years. It does however let out a thin plume of smoke occasionally that will panic the Sakire near its base: as if the Nakibeli weren't high-strung already.

Beyond these mountains are the Wastes of the Pilgrims and the Free Clans: a marginal and unbountiful land that stretches deep into the interior towards the North Pole. Not much is known of there, other than that its inhabitants are coarse and hardbitten fighting hunger and wandering golems. This land gives eventually becomes an arctic wasteland as it leaves Kyahida and enters Esoenska.

## Kyahida and its People

The Sakire have lived in Kyahida for at least a thousand years, and for the longest time have lived as semi-nomadic people: depending on the availability of food and the season, they will move between different camps. Although this pattern holds today for most Sakire living in Esoenska (scattered though they may be), the story is a bit different in the region of Kyahida. The Hyalisam waters are particularly prosperous, and the watershed of the Jezzali river is sheltered from arctic winds and fed fresh water from surrounding mountains, its soil fertile from a glacier past. All of this combine together with a favorable latitude to make Kyahida amenable to sedentary life, and many Sakire have opted for such a life.

Sakire maintain the old ways and will migrate on a long cycle, but will do so within a fixed region. This has led to the rise of a handful of city-states that have become the local centers of trade for their area. Each city state is presided over by a Castellan, who resides on a Throne. The cities are called after this throne ('Bel' in the Jezzali language)  and the warlord who built it. Thus, you have the Throne of Jeze, the Throne of Sera, the Throne of Kicab, and so on: The City States of Kyahida:

</figure>

Each Throne has a domain over which it guarantees the Law of its castellan which are shown on the map. The Throne of Jeze 'Jezebel' is the foremost of peers, being the largest and most influential domain in Kyahida, and is the location of the Castellan Court. In Earthly terms, the political organization of Kyahida is inspired by the city-states of Sumeria, crossed with something like the Iroquois Federation. Here, I briefly detail each Throne: what its land is like, its primary activities and concerns, and a bite of its history.

### Jezebel

<span class="marginnote">
	<img src="{{site.url}}/{{page.assets}}/Jezebel.svg" alt=""/>
  The Jezzali river primarily defines the lands of Jezebel
</span>

Jezebel is the navel of the world, a sprawling metropolis of 15,000 permanent residents situated on the sleepy Jezzali river meeting with the Hyalisam. Jezebel is the indisputable center of trade, religion, and culture in Kyahida, and is the only true 'city' in our modern eyes. Further, Jezebel hosts the "Remnant of Makka", a glistening white spire not built by Sakire hands, which inspires otherworldly fear and awe... the perfect site for a Capitol. The true secret of Jezebel's preeminence, however, is the fact of its large hinterland on the Jezzali river. The new technology of agriculture is very rudimentary and sporadic in Kyahida (amounting mostly to coppiced orchards and ad-hoc plantings), but where it exists it exists on the Jezzali, and the surpluses float down the river to Jezebel.

Jezebel is unique amongst the thrones for being the 'prize' offered to the strongest Castellan in the federation. A long period of consolidated power under the Castellans of Viurabel has recently ended after the conquest of Jezebel and its hinterland by Gugal of Kicabal and Sekka of Nakibel, the former becoming the new ruler.

Although obviously holding the various Thrones to its bosom, Jezebel also serves as a cultural center for the barbarians beyond the domain of law: the Hill People of the Sansari Range, the Pilgrim Clans of the North, and the Flat Hat People of the West all enjoy the privelage of Pilgrimage to Jezebel every 5 years. This pilgrimage allows these non-citizens to see the Remnant of Makka, trade, and discuss affairs. In return, hillside and upriver raids are asked to be minimized and tribute brought: a system for relative peace. Every time Jezebel has fallen has been because of another throne making common cause with disgruntled tribes denied their pilgrimage, the most recent of which being Kicabi alliance with Sansibel and the Hill People.

*Viurabel* is the easternmost settlement worth the name in Kyahida, and serves as a second pole of power within the domain of Jezebel. Although the city of Jezebel has always outshone Viurabel, the local leaders are more closely tied to the most sedentary of the watershed: the farmers. In times when the city of Jezebel reflects the desires of the other city states more than the riverland, Viurabel serves as the lightning rod where the people on the river mount rebellion, often in aliance with Nakibel and the Pilgrim Clans. Viurabel periodically becomes the throne when Jezebel fails in its duty to its domain.

### Sansibel

<span class="marginnote">
  Sansibel is hard to traverse by land, but makes easy coast for Sansibi fishermen
</span>

Sansibel is one of the smaller lands in Kyahida, squished between the Sansari mountain range and the Hyalisam and often playing second fiddle to the more lucrative neighbor states of Jezebel and Kicabel. However, Sansibel is critical to the safety of the city-states because of its historical ties to the Hill People. The Hill People are a neutral party of barbarians whom Sansibel denizens amicably split off from over a hundred years ago, and maintain a relationship to this day. Without Sansibel's influence and care, the Hill People raid the watershed of the Jezzali river and allow the hostile Free Clans through their territory, causing havoc for every other city state. This gives Sansibel a comfortable political position, and as such they receive subsidies from their otherwise more wealthy neighbors.

### Kicabel

<span  class="marginnote">
  The Kicabi are the most hardbitten Sakire in Kyahida: one suspects they only care to associate with other Sakire to boast over shellfish.
</span>

Kicabel has a ferocious reputation, its culture being somewhat more martial than the rest of the city states. Wedged between the warlike Free Clans on one side, and merciless Golems on the other, Kicab has always bred a higher order of warrior. Nothing is of greater proof than the fact that Kicab has seized Jezebel by rightful arms on its lonesome, with only the latter acquiesence of the other city states ending hostilities.

Kicabel is more than warriors though: they are well known for their clams, which they harvest from the turgid channels that signal the end of the Hyalisam. They are also the route by which most arcane golem salvage from Desribel reaches the rest of Kyahida, the blades of which bear no small responsibility for Kicabel's premier equipment.

### Desribel

<span class="marginnote">
  The kind reader is exhorted to avoid Desribel if you've no reason to go: lousy weather and worse food
</span>

Desribel is only a 'throne' out of courtesy: its people have much more in common with the maligned Free Clans, and are certainly the most mercenary of city-states. What the city lacks in legitimacy, they make up for in spirit: their home lies wedged between two of the most dangerous Golem populations in the whole of the Nenth, and it is here that Sakire go to hunt Golems, rather than the other way around. The tiny village of Desribel is literally a warehouse to stow salvaged Golem parts before making the dangerous trek up the valley to Kicabel, a meagre dock for some fishing boats to feed the hunters, and a strip of longhouses for carousing and brawling.

### Ricabel

<span class="marginnote">
	<img src="{{site.url}}/{{page.assets}}/Ricabel.svg" alt=""/>
  It's perhaps good for Kyahida that the Ricabi's meekness is matched only by their entrepreneurship, or life on the Hyalisam would be much less bustling
</span>

Ricabel sits on the isthmus between the Nakaija and the Hyalisam, and commands a strategic position on the land route between Jezebel and the lands of the south. Whaling and portage of goods from one water to another are the consistent trade services that the Ricabi offer, their domain including the old whaling village of Ladibel, a defunct throne. The Ricabi are perhaps the most 'foreign' of the civilized Sakire, despite their proximity to Jezebel: the Ricabi are the elements of the Lake Peeker and Quiet Friend tribes that seeked to engage openly with the Castellans, and have guaranteed a refuge for their compatriots on the peninsula in return for peaceful access to the Isthmus of their domain. This arrangment has held (with periodic lapses) for hundreds of years, breaches typically coming as result of Nakibi disputes on the Nakaija.

*Ladibel* is a cluster of huts near the entry to the Hyalisam. It serves as an important layover for long-passage ships to Serabel and Desribel, and a frontier trading post with the peaceful yet territorial Quiet Friends. Its most famous feature is being the location of the College of the Imrais, an order of religious zealots that are famous for exorcising 'bad spirits'.

### Nakibel

<span class="marginnote">
	<img src="{{site.url}}/{{page.assets}}/Nakibel.svg" alt=""/>
  The Nakibi people have a festival each year where they send burning boats off the shore to fend off bad luck from across the lake. The Lake Peekers do the same.
</span>

On the placid waters of the Nakaija, Nakibel rests nestled between Mount Miandur and Mount Kyo-Sara, with an easy passage to Viurabel. Despite the picturesque Hyalisam, Nakibel may still lay claim to the title of most scenic land in Kyahida, particulary in the fall where rare deciduous ferns and conifers turn red on the lake's shores.

Politically, Nakibel is the middle-child of Kyahida: not quite as big and powerful as Jezebel, nor as exotic and interesting as the Ricabi. Additionally, because of the Serabi pact with the Flat Hat Tribe of Kyo-Sara, and the Ricabi pact with the Lake Peekers, Nakibel's ambition to control the Nakaija is consistently thwarted. Given all of this, the Nakibel castellan is typically the most noisome and petulant ruler at the Castellan Court.

### Serabel

<span class="marginnote">
	<img src="{{site.url}}/{{page.assets}}/Serabel.svg" alt=""/>
  The Serran plain features the largest spore fields in Kyahida. In some parts, the mycospores are so numerous that their fog is a dangerous psychoactive hazard
</span>

Last, but not least, is the Throne of Sera. Serabel is an isolated land, surrounded on all sides by reticent clans and golems. Unlike the embattled Kicabi, however, the Serabi have only recently formed their nation, and are the most 'clan-like' of all the city-states. Serabel, as an actual settlement, exists only for 4 months of the year when the Clanmeet is held - the rest of the year is spent in the old way. Indeed, the Serabi were considered one of the Pilgrim Clans within living memory. That changed 80 years ago, when the Serabi demonstrated the existence of their town to Jezzali magistrates, and pledged allegiance. In return, the Serabi make their pilgrimage directly through the Nakaija (after passing through their Flat Hat friends' territory) to Jezebel, rather than going all the way around the east of Kyo-Sara.

## Conclusion

<span class="marginnote">
	<img src="{{site.url}}/{{page.assets}}/ForWebPugetComparison.jpg" alt=""/>
  Kyahida is inspired by the Pacific Northwest, and particularly the Puget Sound. Jezebel sits where Seattle would,and the other cities are placed in locations similar to Tacoma, Everett, Olympia, and Mt. Vernon. Kyo-Sara is cribbed right from Mount Rainier.

There's so much more to be said, but even with only the most cursory descriptions of the main highlights, this post has gotten too long. There will be future posts detailing each area in more detail, more maps, and things not covered at all (like the various unincorporated tribes, the Golems, the Remnant, etc). For now, I've been working on the topography of the area in a preparatory effort to figure out all the micro-climates of the area, so I can know exactly what food is where and which fish can be had! Here's a sneak peek... several scrapped copies and some colored pencils later:
