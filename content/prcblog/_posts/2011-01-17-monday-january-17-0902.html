Moved into my new work-owned apartment, and it is pretty okay. I have a nice warm room with a view, and it is only about 2 minutes between my bed and my workdesk, so I can sleep in a little bit more now.<br /><br />Had a good weekend, and feeling a bit more optimistic going into work today. Let's see how long that lasts, ahha.
