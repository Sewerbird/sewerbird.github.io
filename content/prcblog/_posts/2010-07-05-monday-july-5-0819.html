Well, it seems the wet season has hit Shanghai, and everything is covered in rain. It made me think of the lovely summer weather Seattle is supposed to have. The Koppen Climate Classification is a way of, naturally, classifying climates of certain places. Shanghai is Humid Temperate - Hot Summer, also called Cf-a. Seattle is Humid Temperate - Cool Summer, also called Cf-b. Since I generally love the weather of the Pacific Northwest (as opposed to the more humid/hot East Coast or Coastal China), I looked up a world climate map and tried to find places I'd like.<br /><br />Here are all the Cf-b regions I could find: <br /><br />Pacific Northwest<br />Very South Fjords of Chile<br />Lower right-side coast of South africa<br />United Kingdom<br />North of France<br />Belgium<br />Netherlands<br />Germany<br />Denmark<br />South Sweden<br />Norwegian coast<br />Tasmania<br />South Western Australian coast<br />New Zealand<br /><br />Based on this, here are some cities I might like to live in:<br />Seattle, USA<br />Vancouver, Canada<br />Portland, USA<br />Dublin, Ireland<br />London, UK<br />Liverpool, UK<br />Edinburgh, UK<br />Lille, France<br />Brest, France<br />Paris, France<br />Brussels, Belgium<br />Amsterdam, Netherlands<br />Hamburg, Germany<br />Frankfurt, Germany<br />Berlin, Germany<br />Copenhagen, Denmark<br />Gdansk, Poland<br />Prague, Czech Republic<br />Oslo, Norway<br />Trondheim, Norway<br />Stockholm, Sweden<br />Gdansk, Poland<br />Port Elizabeth, South Africa<br />Puerto Aisen, Chile<br />Melbourne, Australia<br />Canberra, Australia<br />Hobart, Australia<br />Wellington, New Zealand<br />Auckland, New Zealand<br />Christchurch, Ne Zealand<br /><br />And so, yeah... pretty good selection I think!
