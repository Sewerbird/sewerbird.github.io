<div>Although I of course miss friends and loved ones, it is easy to be strong and enjoy what I am doing at the moment. However, the things that most consistently have me going "uggh, I wish I had some ---" and "argh, this isn't like ---" are the following:</div><div><br /></div>Little Things I Miss:<div>1- Doritos: Every chip here is meat or fish flavored, nothing else, not even Sour Cream or Salt &amp; Pepper, and absolutely no chance of a cheesy tortilla chip.</div><div>2- Tap Water: You can't drink water that has come from the tap, only boiled or bottled water, unless you want to risk a microbial stomach sickness.</div><div>3- Sandwiches: There. Are. No. Sandwiches. In. China.</div><div>4- My Laptop's Virginity: Before I came to China, my laptop was fine. Now, due to the petri dish that is the workplace network, it is crawling with viruses that I will have to nuke when I get back.</div><div>5- Easy Banking: Every mechanism to stop Chinese people from stealing my money online works great. Too bad I'm 'Chinese'.</div>
