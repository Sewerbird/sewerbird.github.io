Hey there, potpourri news time:<br /><br />1. Being moved by the company to another apartment. Should be a grand distance of two blocks away. Hopefully this one has a heater.<br />2. Got onto facebook, although I can't click on most of the buttons, nor log-in. I can only change my status (which I dislike doing) and replying to direct e-mails.<br />3. It's really cold here, and I miss the sanity of the USA.
