I am pretty sure I am in a stretched-time phenomenon: the fact that my blogs are spacing out pretty continuously is my evidence. I am often surprised that an entire week can pass by so quickly: it feels just like yesterday that I was in Hong Kong. But the truth is that, with only 2 weeks left, I am temporally hurtling towards my departure from China for home for a whole month and a half, and I am excited! Gotta make sure to get my gift-buying caught up...
