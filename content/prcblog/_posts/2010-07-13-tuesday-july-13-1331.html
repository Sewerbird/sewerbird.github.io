Rainy tuesday, bleh.<br /><br />Just working here, although almost all the creative part of the job is behind me: it's making list after list now, and not having any player game data to play with for at least a month. Keeping on top of it, but it certainly isn't as dynamic at the moment as it often can be. Working on various small projects at the moment creatively off-work, such as practicing my dialog-writing skills, working on my language (came up with how I'm gonna do names, if you haven't noticed), and other things. Am going on a safari this weekend with Chris, so will make sure to get pictures as long as we don't get rained out. Hope all is going well for you all!
