Pretty slow week: just recharging and getting ready for the last push for development. I've been coming up with some new game ideas, and I'll propose one to Zhang soonish, although I imagine that he'd wait to come on board for another project until the end of this one. I am thinking of how/when I'll get a little vacation while I'm here in China, since I haven't ventured beyond Shanghai Municipality nor Jiangsu or Anhui Province.
