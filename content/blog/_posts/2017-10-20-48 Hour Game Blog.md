Welcome to the blog for my attempt to create a game in 48 hours. I'll be keeping my status and some notes in here, and when I'm done I'll morph it into a post-mortem.

You can watch the livestream (if I'm not sleeping) at [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/sewerbird)

## Overview

The goal of this attempt is to create a small game using Love2D, from the initial idea to final conception, within a span of 48 hours. I am beginning right after work on a friday at Coderbunker, here in Shanghai China

## Starting: 8:00pm China Standard Time

First I need a game idea: something simple enough for me to pull off in such a brief amount of time. I didn't allow myself to work or even think about the task before I decided to do it. However, I think I can hack together a real brief Final Fantasy or Pokemon-style game. I can do most of the coding Friday and Saturday, and add in-game content and such on Sunday.

### 13:30 Sleep

### 9:00 Wakeup & Coffee

I'm feeling refreshed, having slept well and given myself a clean shave and shower: only coffee left before resuming work. Although I woke up with ideas to make the map isometric, it is more important to sort out a Pokemon-style combat screen as well as a dialog system today for the core game play. I figure today will be focusing on the fundamentals, and Sunday can be spent making levels, sprites, and dialog before the deadline.'
