Just because, the names of everyone who has posted on this blog in my made-up language (sorry if I missed someone! it won't let me search through comments):

Take your name from this list...

Edward  : Guardian  = Saribke "suh-RIHV-kuh"
Kirk    : Church    = Sidhe "SEE-theh"
Tamara  : Palm Tree = Nesuldha "neh-SULTH-uh"
Barbara : Stranger  = Risdha "RIZ-thuh"
George  : Farmer    = Suasre "SWAHZ-ruh"
Rachel  : Lamb      = Kerenme "ke-REN-muh"
Ronald  : Advisor   = Diceke "di-JEHK-uh"
Michael : Who's like god? = Israel "is-RA-ehl"  (funny coincidence, that name!)

And then put your last name after it...

Miller: "In misty lands" = ne Seraba      "neh  seh-RAV-ah"
Marler: "In wild lands" = ne Relaba       "neh  reh-LAV-ah"
Davis: "In sunny lands" = ne Kaliba       "neh  kah-LIV-ah"

(These are the place-locations I associate with the lastnames: mom's side is generally in the West out in the country, dad's side I associate with the Pacific Northwest, and Rachel is from California.)

So I'd be

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Saribke ne Seraba</span>
