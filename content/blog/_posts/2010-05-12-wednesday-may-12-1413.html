I've been given a simulator to play with, and so have been doing SCIENCE at work, looking at the statistics coming out of relevant populations. It's fun, but tests take a long time to conclude, so I mostly doodle and wait to analyze the results when done.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a beautiful spring in Shanghai!
