Another day, another couple-hundred Mao.

This has been the longest-feeling month back ever, and I hope the rest of my contract doesn't feel so fatiguing. I've got a couple remedies to the work crush though:

On Mondays: D&D excitement (@ evening)
On Tuesdays: Tired from staying up too late.
On Wednesdays: Goth-Night partying (@ evening)
On Thursdays: Tired from staying up too late.
On Fridays: Poker Night or Night-In (@ evening)
On Saturdays: Tired from staying up too late. Prepare for Monday.
On Sundays: Adventure around Shanghai, get some sleep.

I also have Armin Van Buuren this Sunday, and Toby comes two weeks from today-ish. Both of those are good to look forward to!
