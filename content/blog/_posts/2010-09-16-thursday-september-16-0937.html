Very very close now: arriving back early-early on Monday, so have been *super* busy making sure the project can continue in my absence, drawing up documentation, instructions, and lists for things to do while I'm away. In this way, I can feel truly able to take my time off, well, off. Gotta run all the way to the finish line though.
