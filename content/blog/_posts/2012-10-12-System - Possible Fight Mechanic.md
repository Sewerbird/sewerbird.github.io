I've been running some playtests to figure out a satisfying way

to run bread &amp; butter combats in the roleplaying game. I have a
couple objectives:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Never have a meaningless "miss"
2. A complex attack should nonetheless be simple to 'bookkeep'
3. Emphasize tactical movement without requiring a grid/minis</p>
The idea I came up with for doing a basic attack (whether with
a femur or a pistol) is to smush together the gestalt result of
the strike all into one opposed roll. The difference of the
opposed results is then credited as a success to whomever won.
My thinking is that each weapon has a base damage, and you add
the degree of success to the final dealt damage. An example
playtest follows.
<blockquote>Saribke has been avoiding a stalking golem for half a day now,
but has stumbled into a cul-de-sac where the predator has
cornered him! The golem is eight meters tall, a gangly thing
that would surely be covered in coarse bristly fur if it was a
thing of flesh: the juts in its face recall a cat stuck in a
downpour.

Saribke uses an action to Inquire<span style="color: #00ffff;"> "Is there an apparent weak </span>
<span style="color: #00ffff;">spot I can strike on the golem with my polearm?"</span> = <span style="color: #00ff00;">5 (Yes)</span>. The
golem is vulnerable to strikes focused on a shoddy power
coupling on its pelvis: get +2 to Fight rolls if you make a
successful Senses check (DN 5).

Saribke uses an action to perform a Senses check to see the
weak spot: he rolls a 7, so notices the vulnerability. He also
sees the golem charge toward him (Move + Fight)!

The golem has colossal fists (7 damage), and uses a Pummel
attack (Rating 4). Saribke raises his polearm (4 damage) to
block, using his Fight skill (Rating 7 including the
vulnerability of the golem... Saribke is very skilled). They
roll their dice, with the golem getting 8 and Saribke getting
11. The difference is 3 in Saribke's favor!

Saribke skillfully dodges aside, the haft of his polearm
deflecting a swipe from the golem, and brings the business-end
of the weapon against the golem's pelvis in a counterattack.
Saribke does 4 damage from his polearm rating, and 3 extra
damage from his degree of success for a total of 7 damage
against the golem (on the golem's turn!). Now it is Saribke's
turn, where he will likely press his advantage.</blockquote>
I like the counterattacking nature of this tactic, and
hopefully this'll reduce the length of combats. It also might
result in combat being seen as the risky endeavor it is,
although I have some concerns about non-duel combat using this
mechanic: being mobbed might be very deadly, perhaps more than
I intend. For now, though, I'm happy with it.
