Although it's been ridiculously busy roping the game design back together, it is going as well as I could hope for. To reward myself after payday, I've bought tickets to see  <a href="http://www.smartshanghai.com/smartticket/armin-van-buuren-m2">Armin Van Buuren at M2</a> at the end of the month. It'll be nice to finally see him live, although I've never been to such a crowded venue before. Hopefully the candymen don't come out too strongly!
