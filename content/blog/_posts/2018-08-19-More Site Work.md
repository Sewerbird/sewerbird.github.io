I'll be working this week on making this website a bit more navigable and boosting the content a bit. Noticeable changes include:

- Front page reformatted to include a sidebar with personal info that was otherwise over-hidden in the `About` page.
- Graphical brand fixes: the animated Sewerbird image is less distracting and used in fewer places. Top bar made prettier.
- **Improved Links**: It is much easier to navigate the site's content by following 'prev' and 'next' links at the tops and bottoms of articles.
- Hiding older, less relevent stuff: my old china and rpg-design posts are reachable via the All Blog directory and the linknet, but no longer featured on frontpage.
- **Improved Code Rendering**: I've finally sat down for an hour and set up syntax highlighting in my articles.
- Fix old javascript games: some of my older javascript demos haven't aged well, so I've brought them back to life.

Overall, the changes are subtle but greatly improved the usefulness of the blog for myself.
