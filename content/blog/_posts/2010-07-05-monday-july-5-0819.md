Well, it seems the wet season has hit Shanghai, and everything is covered in rain. It made me think of the lovely summer weather Seattle is supposed to have. The Koppen Climate Classification is a way of, naturally, classifying climates of certain places. Shanghai is Humid Temperate - Hot Summer, also called Cf-a. Seattle is Humid Temperate - Cool Summer, also called Cf-b. Since I generally love the weather of the Pacific Northwest (as opposed to the more humid/hot East Coast or Coastal China), I looked up a world climate map and tried to find places I'd like.

Here are all the Cf-b regions I could find: 

Pacific Northwest
Very South Fjords of Chile
Lower right-side coast of South africa
United Kingdom
North of France
Belgium
Netherlands
Germany
Denmark
South Sweden
Norwegian coast
Tasmania
South Western Australian coast
New Zealand

Based on this, here are some cities I might like to live in:
Seattle, USA
Vancouver, Canada
Portland, USA
Dublin, Ireland
London, UK
Liverpool, UK
Edinburgh, UK
Lille, France
Brest, France
Paris, France
Brussels, Belgium
Amsterdam, Netherlands
Hamburg, Germany
Frankfurt, Germany
Berlin, Germany
Copenhagen, Denmark
Gdansk, Poland
Prague, Czech Republic
Oslo, Norway
Trondheim, Norway
Stockholm, Sweden
Gdansk, Poland
Port Elizabeth, South Africa
Puerto Aisen, Chile
Melbourne, Australia
Canberra, Australia
Hobart, Australia
Wellington, New Zealand
Auckland, New Zealand
Christchurch, Ne Zealand

And so, yeah... pretty good selection I think!
