So much snow!<br /><br />Sadly, it had accumulated about 3 inches when the snow turned into freezing rain and washed all the snow away.<br /><br />I think once spring comes around, I'll start exercising maybe. I feel really sedentary as of late, and the whole 'living one floor above my workplace' is making me feel like I never get outside.
