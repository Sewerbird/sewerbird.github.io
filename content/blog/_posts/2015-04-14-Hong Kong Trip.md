I entered a market distortion so strong I blinked into and out of Hong Kong!

#Background#

The visa I have to enter China is a little bit funky, and basically boils down to the following:

- I may enter China as many times as I like for the next ten years
- I may only stay in China for 60 days at a time
- Each stay must be bracketed by an international border crossing

The person in mind for this visa, I presume, is frequently returning tourists going on asian adventures and foreign business men who want to check up on their overseas divisions or potential clients. What it isn't meant for is for someone like me who is hanging around Shanghai for long blocks of time. You see, I intend to linger on in China for several more months yet, much longer than a single stay allows. So, how?

#The Strategy#

I fully intend to follow the restrictions of the visa, and that presents me with the pressing concern of how to most efficiently 're-enter' the country. Obvious candidates are a bit distant, since I live in Shanghai: every other country is quite far, and on relatively expensive flights. The cheapest possible (in terms of money) transit would be taking a *boat* to Japan across the Yellow Sea, a voyage taking 2-3 days in accomadations not much more plush than a local transit bus seat. Further, the opportunity cost of spending a whole week on an aquatic can is unacceptable.

Luckily, there is a wrinkle: Hong Kong.

Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region in China, which has as its primary consequence it being a gray area. Although the details elude me, the result is that crossing into Hong Kong is subject to immigration check, and is equivalent to entering a different country. In the USA, this would be like if you needed to pass through Customs to enter Hawaii from the Continental USA: you'd have left the 'country' of Mainland USA to the special mini-country of USA - (Hawaii).

All this to say that I can get a domestic-rate airfare to Hong Kong, and have it count as a reentry, thus renewing my visa's 60 days upon return. This is made convenient by the fact that I need no visa to enter Hong Kong, only my passport.

Keeping my belt tight and wallet tighter, I arranged to leave Pudong International Airport in the morning, arriving in Hong Kong around noon. I then proceeded to bum around the airport until my flight back into China finally showed up in the evening. As I type this, I am flying back to Shanghai! Once I land, I'll breeze through customs and take a taxi back home, the project complete.

#My Commentary#

At the blatant risk of talking about politics, I'll state that this is a pretty ridiculous distortion in my daily life, and is an arbitrary expression of State power. Men with guns and the fearful self-division of humanity from itself has touched my life today, shrinking my bank account in a coerced transaction drawn out through a cattledrive using magnificient flying machines to far flung lands. Short of the elimination of visa requirements across national borders, I'd settle for being able to walk into a local police station, hand over my money, do a couple jumping jacks, and carry on with my life.

This was a waste of time that I'll have to repeat in the future.

That said, objectively, China is much more clement, efficient, and professional during the process than the brutish thugs I deal with back in the airports of my own home country. However, it's still coercion: just with a smile instead of a glare.

End Rant. Back to wonderful daily life in the morning.
