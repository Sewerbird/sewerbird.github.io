Welcome to the EIC Dungeons & Dragon's Campaign, run by yours truly!

## Schedule

We will play twice a month, aiming for every-other-week. Seven people have 'signed up', and the campaign will accomodate drop-ins and drop-outs week to week. The first session will be Wednesday January 3rd, 2018, where we will make characters and get the start of the adventure going. You will need the following:

  - Yourself in good spirits
  - A refreshment
  - A Pencil
  - Some Paper
  - [Your Character Sheet](http://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/DDALRoD_CharacterSheet.pdf)
  - Full set of dice

A few sets of dice and some extra materials will be available, but it's best to make sure you bring your own stuff for maximum convenience.

## Campaign Character Creation Rules

This version of D&D is new for everyone at the table, including me, so we will be keeping it simple.

  - We will be rolling 1st Level Characters
  - Come to the table with a character concept (Race, Class, Background, Spells, and personality)
  - I will preside over your Attribute Score rolls. We will follow the standard 'random attributes' process as described in the rules, unless I have granted you a specific exception.
  - I will not be allowing Multiclassing before 5th level.

## Campaign Rules

Players join the game by creating a 1st level character of any race, class, and background using the resources in the Player's Handbook available for sale in stores, or the [Free Basic Rules available Online](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules?x=dnd/basicrules).

This is a **LOW MAGIC** setting. As such, players do not automatically learn new spells when they level up: you must find or buy a scroll or tutor before you can put it in your spellbook. This restriction doesn't apply while you are creating your character: you choose spells as normal. You gain spell slots normally as you level.

## Campaign Setting

The campaign will start and stay relatively near the town of Hasslehold on the southern tip of Lake Naka. There are swamps, dense forest, and volcanic mountain ranges all within several days journey of the town, and should provide plenty of adventure for this year.

Here is a map of the environs I drew up. Although it is fairly accurate, it serves as a mental map more than a GPS survey.

(You can access an annotated, larger version of the map [here]({{site.url}}/assets/EICDNDCampaign/CampaignMapAnnotated.png).)

New Hasslehold is an important strategic location for the kingdom of Nakibel, sitting as it does at the far end of a huge lake and at the foothills of the mountain pass to the South. The town tends its flocks, fishes the lake and marsh, and maintains the trade route passing through beneath the wooden Hasslehold Keep.

This is a frontier land, and not well-cultivated: the grazing fields and coppiced groves turn quickly into wild alpine forest, its underbrush dark and difficult. The Great Mount Kyosara looms on the horizon, but more closely Signal Ridge surveys the Meekdim Forest that abuts Hasslehold.

There used to be an old site for Hasslehold, now aptly called Old Hasslehold. It lays inland on broken trail, its stone keep broken by a war two hundred years ago. Locals consider the place one of ill omen, and avoid it.

The campaign begins at the town square of Hasslehold, as our heroes hear word of an Imperial tax collector arriving: in such a small town, any kind of outsider is of natural interest.
