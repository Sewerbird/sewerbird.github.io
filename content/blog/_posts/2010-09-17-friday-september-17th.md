This is my 248th day in China which means that I will leave on my 250th day, a nice round number to remember.

This is also my last day at work for this trip, and I have received my payment and tickets. My aide is assigned his tasks, the project leaders have been consulted, and the plans have been drawn for their actions while I'm absent. Saying a little farewell to the troops of the team, and putting in order my last preparation for departure. I hope to write a 'reflection' tomorrow, and post it when I come back.

What a successful trip!
