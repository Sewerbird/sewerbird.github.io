Friday Jan 15 1645<br />Almost end of work here, and I get the weekends off. I don't have internet access at the apartment yet, so I may not be able to post the next two days: I will write my blogs like usual on my laptop into text files, but I might have to post them Monday. Will try to get internet though: just don't worry that I got hit by a bus or anything... even though it is quite possible, I am being particularly paranoid about not being roadkill (Dad would hate crossing the streets here, lol).
