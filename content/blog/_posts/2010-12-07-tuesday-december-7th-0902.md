Toby has arrived! I took Monday off and showed him how to use the subway, and I took him to some of the easier-to-get-to tourist spots, and we also went to a Buddhist temple. He'll be joining in on my D&D game tonight with the other guys, but generally off doing whatever while I have work. So it's nice to have a friend from the states come visit!

Just working otherwise, although I'll probably have to sneak in some D&D preparation at lunch today.
