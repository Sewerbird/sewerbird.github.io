Sadly, I had my bike stolen Saturday night from out in front of work: it was locked and stuff, but it's light enough that they probably just lifted it into a truckbed. A shame, but isn't a huge loss and was fun while it lasted. I likely won't get a replacement. Probably for the best: riding without plates or helmet was starting to attract unwanted attention from the beefed up police presence (for the World Expo). I did get a package from Dad, though, so that's pretty sweet!
