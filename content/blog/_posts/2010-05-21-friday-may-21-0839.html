For your convenience, you may also pay by major credit card, debit card or electronic check by calling 1-800-947-5096. <br /><br />If you have any questions about your account, please call us at 1-800-947-5096 and an AT&T representative will be glad to assist you. <br /><br />Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. <br /><br /><br />AT&T </blockquote><br /><br />Not only did I have it cancelled anyways 3 months ago but... seriously? Fifty-seven cents?
