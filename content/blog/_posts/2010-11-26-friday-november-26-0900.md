I am sick: yesterday I slept 24 hours in interrupted bursts. Half the reason I'm in work today is because I cannot endure another day on my less-than-comfortable mattress. It will probably be a half-day regardless, and I have to make sure I don't spread it: gonna wash hands frequently, not touch public things (like door knobs) and ensure I don't talk into anyone's face. Feeling a bit better today, but I hope I'm okay for the concert on Sunday.
