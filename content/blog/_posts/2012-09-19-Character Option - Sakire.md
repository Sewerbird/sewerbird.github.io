This character option is for players who want to be born without exotic traits, instead gaining the benefits of having to find their own innate talents. Nearly all the civilized population of Jezevel are Sakire, and choosing this option allows for the character's fate to be less determined by the paranormal abilities of the likes of Imrais, Gemini, and Psykers. Sakire are the ones who most often man the boats, sell the wares, write the books, walk the beats, and perform the plays.

Despite a close similarity and nature to humans in our world, there are a few subtle differences. The everyman Sakire would seem to be 'luckier': things tend to work out more often than not. Even in a grim situation, small boons the Sakire happen upon smooth the tough times. Spare coins on the ground are discovered more often, lost keys are more likely to be hidden in a pants' pocket, and so on. Some rare Sakire become so lucky that they can achieve marvelous feats in skills they've never tried, although most Sakire are nowhere near this fortunate.

You may choose Sakire as your Birth background. If you do so, you gain the special Luck attribute at rank 1. You may roll your Luck skill when you try to overcome an obstacle through sheer luck or serendipity. If you are performing an investigation, for example, and have no leads nor ideas, you might try to go to a bar and hope for a coincidental meeting with a witness: it's not necessarily likely to work, but maybe for you! Your luck also becomes apparent when hurt: the cut on your throat will tend to not have hit your jugular vein, and such. Every turn, you may regenerate a number of hit points equal to your Luck attribute.

As an additional choice, you may instead forfeit the surfeit of luck by not gaining the Luck attribute. In this event, you get +1 to any core attribute (Body, Mind, Social, Senses), and an extra Skill associated with your Upbringing background. This option is good for people who want their 'luck' to manifest in the skills they use, rather than the situations they escape.

Sakire are well adapted to a myriad of tasks, backgrounds, and futures. They also get access to several cultural positions that are normally closed to non-Sakire, such as nobility and command positions in the military. Sakire are a great choice if you want a versatile blank-slate to create your character from, a heroic protagonist, or someone who can engage society on their own terms.
