Yesterday being payday, I decided to treat myself to one of <a href="http://www.wacom.com/bamboo/bamboo_pen.php">these</a>. It's pretty awesome, and I can actually draw on my laptop now. Quite recommended: it's like having a gazillion pens, markers, pastels, and some brushes once you get the settings tuned.
