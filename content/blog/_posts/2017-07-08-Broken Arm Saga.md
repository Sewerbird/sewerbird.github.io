I broke my arm last month, and I've finally gotten around to writing an account of my summer so far! I've included some pictures for posterity, and so there is a mild 'gross!' factor: you've been warned!

## Preface

I'd like to quickly note that I don't have pictures of all the beautiful friends who came to help me and visit me in the hospital, and for that I'm truly regretful: the experience for me is remembered by whose faces I was looking at, and this recounting suffers from not being able to print out my visual memories into an image file.

## The Mountain

The story begins on 莫干山, "Moganshan", a mountain situated about three hours' drive south of Shanghai near the city of Deqing. In high spirits with many of my coworkers, we had set out that morning on a bus from work for a kind of team-building thing: slip off to the mountains during the weekdays and enjoy a wilderness retreat! The weather wasn't really on our side, however: rained the entire day.

Having wound our way up the switchbacking roads to near the top of the mountain, a little chalet amongst the bamboo forest was ours: a three story tall house with at least 10 bedrooms. There were a lot of us there: just about the entire tech section of EIC-NewPathways! Pulling out the beer and groceries, we set out to enjoy the rainy, misty afternoon by getting drunk, loud, and comradely on the patio. We even got the grill going. We played card games, told jokes, went into the rain to haggle at local corner shops, poking around the trails, and arm-wrestling matches.

All was going well, until I broke my arm at 7:00

## Down the Mountain

I looked down impassively at my arm for an hour. Or, at least that's how long it seemed to me: the clock on the wall probably only reported about half a second. My arm was being very curious: where I felt my arm to be disagreed violently with where my eyes were saying it was: they had the gall to report my arm to be about 30 degrees away from the space of empty air where my arm "really" was. There is an experience described by paraplegics, where (despite lacking a limb), they 'feel' that they have a phantom limb. In exactly this manner I felt. About another hour later (to finish up the second), I realized my arm had dislocated at the elbow or broken: the simple fix seemed to be to match up where my eyes said my arm was and where I thought it should be, so I grasped my arm and held it across my belly

By the time this second had finished up, the incredibly loud "CRACK!" of my bone breaking had stopped echoing like a snapped tree branch. I let out an incredibly manly "YELP!", held my arm in place, and began watching myself for signs of shock: I went to sit down amongst everyone. Everyone took a second to realize there was a problem, and started to become horrified as it dawned what had happened. Stefan Fuchs helped keep me calm with his trademark style of conversation, while a van was being mobilized by Gabriel Paquin and Naomi Li. Gingerly walking down yet more slippery steps, I slid into the vehicle with Gabriel and Naomi and we drove down the switchbacked mountain roads yet again.

Naomi rode shotgun to manage directions and comms, while Gabriel joined me in the back seat to help me keep my lower arm still on the windy roads. An eternity later (time dilation is a theme in this account) we arrived in the town of Deqing at the base of Moganshan, and shortly afterwards we were at the emergency entrance of Deqing Hospital.

## Deqing

I have very little experience with western hospitals, but I have some experience with chinese ones: a typical chinese hospital is run with the same level of bedside manner as a Department of Motor Vehicles office. Thankfully, though, Deqing is a sleepy little town and the hospital wasn't busy, so I got immediate inspection. Naomi and Gabriel discussed the details of my situation with the clinician in the ER and I was brought to the xray room and told to drop my arm for a moment. THAT HURT. But I got this picture:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}

{: refdef}

I immediately lost the little hope I had that it was a dislocation they could just 'pop back in': this was a major spiral fracture of my right humerus. There was no way this would be fixed in Deqing: best bet was to return to Shanghai in the morning (it was 8:30pm now) and seek a specialist. 

The doctor slapped on a half-cast, neglecting to place it in a sling. Gabriel did a decent job finding some gauze to make a temporary sling like you'd see in the American Civil War, and we got back into our vehicle: time to sleep the night and get the first train to Shanghai. We wound up the mountain, and returned to the chalet.

## The Mountain, Part II

It was 10:00 by the time we got back, and everyone who had been left behind had fought the buzzkill that an armbreak is with alcohol (admirably so!). I socialized a bit and tried to reassure everyone I would be okay, and that took a while: it was an interesting room where everyone was drunk except me, and they were all very worried for me. Gabriel brought out a bit of 18 year whiskey, and we toasted to my quick recovery: it would be my last sip of drink for a month.

I started to realize how fragile I was when it was time for me to try to sleep upright on a couch. The arm was only stationary in one axis, and any small jostle would make my bones shift. Imagine you are on a camping trip, and you are setting up a tent with a segmentable pole. You know the feeling when you hold the bag containing the pole segments, and how they will shift and slide around each other in a tight bundle? That's a normal sensation except for when it accurately describes your arm, where it becomes a very scary and unsettling feeling. I snuck some tears of fear in when no one was looking.

Gabriel slept on a mattress in my room so I could yelp out if I needed help. It's kind of corny, but I drew real comfort from knowing the Angel Gabriel was there to watch over me. I eventually managed to sleep pseudo-horizontally after many very careful and deliberate movements.

## Morning Train

Once the sun was cresting the mountains I woke up from possibly the least satisfying night of sleep I've ever actually slept (even including transpacific airplane flights). Stephan, Gabriel, Naomi, Dorothy, Elsa, and Amanda were having breakfast, a plate of eggs and toast waiting for me. I nibbled at it, and we speculated about if I would be in a cast. Stefan was certain I wouldn't be, but we all thought he was being silly (he was actually 100% on point!). The plan was that Gabriel would take me back to Shanghai, and the rest would try to enjoy the beautiful day that was shaping up outside. So we went into the van and drove to the train station in Deqing

I was pretty bummed about the arm, but it also dawned on me: this whole thing would mean I'd have to cancel a nice night out I had planned with a girl I had met a few weeks earlier to go to a jazz club called Heyday. That really properly bummed me out, since I started to realize this injury would probably be a big part of my life for at least a few months. I texted and cancelled on the train platform.

{: refdef}

On the train, Gabriel and I started to discuss details about what hospital to go to. I had recommendations from friends on my phone, but Gabriel mentioned that he and his wife had been going to United Children's Hospital lately and were very impressed. It was a bit pricy, but on the company's insurance plan, so perhaps that'd be the best bet. When we arrived in Shanghai, Gabriel called the insurance company and confirmed what needed to be confirmed, and then we were in a cab in Hongqiao on the way to the hospital.

## United In Shanghai

Twenty hours after my arm broke, I sauntered into the sleepiest "Emergency" door I've ever seen on a hospital: we entered Shanghai United Children's Hospital. In quite unavoidable contrast to Deqing and Huashan and other hospitals in China I've more experience with, Shanghai United was obviously competent and compassionate. The ER staff had my vitals taken in about 30 seconds and I was sat waiting on a medical bed for an initial checkup. Admittedly, the checkup was both to confirm my injury as well to ensure I had the cash to afford the quality care. At this point I got a proper sling for my arm, and I rejoiced. Waiting for over an hour for the insurance claim to clear, Gabriel and I shot the breeze, with him fetching some dumplings from a shop around the corner to eat.

Once it was verified that I had sufficient wallet and policy to continue, I was whisked upstairs to an inpatient ward: a spacious hotel room where you can give birth in, die in, or anything between. A specialist orthopedic surgeon would be needed to be called in, but first would come the 3d scan of my arm. A painful horizontal laydown into a magnetron later, and we got this splendid picture:

{: refdef}

Around 5:00 I thanked Gabriel sincerely for his dedicated help, and promised to keep him up to date about developments: I'd been under his dotage for almost a day, and so didn't want to hold him longer than needed. I messaged Nelson Zhang, one of several good friends of mine, to please bring some things from home: sundries, laptop, and such. Him and Sasha Cherkasova came by and chatted to me around 7:00, bringing with them these and, most importantly, my Tiger.

## Waiting

I wake up and have breakfast with Tigris: a stuffed animal and best friend of mine since I was roughly 3. He's a totem pole that marks where Home is, and I've kept him all these years.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Tigris & Breakfast]({{site.url}}/assets/broken_arm_withtigris.png)
{: refdef}

He's a source of strength, and a memory of when my family was whole. Being in China, my Mom, Dad, and siblings are literally a world away, so he kind of serves as a stopgap measure. I've been in touch with my Mom thankfully, with my news filtering out eventually to the rest through her reports, but they can't come. Unfortunately, potent as Tigris is, he enhances an attribute of the hospital in a negative way: timelessness.

</script>

I start to measure time in terms of people visiting, and thankfully I had many visits before surgery. Each visit was a welcome tide of real time with real people, and a very real salve on my psyche. Over a dozen people came before my operation: Sasha, Sacha, Gabriel, Nichole, Kahming, Grayson, Ricky, Anja, Naomi & her husband, Nelson, Maggie, Lawrence, and Dmitri.

I have to wait for surgery for several days, because my arm is too swollen: it complicates the surgery. However, several days go by and the swelling doesn't seem to recede: I start to feel tired all the time.

Finally, Sunday arrives.

## Surgery

My doctors came into my room in the morning to make a final judgement call about whether to operate that day, and were almost annoyed at the lack of deflation in my arm: they would have to cut to the bone through an extra inch of flesh, and that's not good. Dr. Dong decided there wasn't much option, however, clapped his hands and (smiling) said "We'll do it"! Within a minute I was on my back on a guerney being carted to the surgical ward.

I'd say that I was more afraid, but frankly I was so tired of waiting for the operation that it was a great relief to be moved into the surgical theater. The whole process was very quick: I barely had a chance to quietly utter 'Godspeed gentlemen' than the anaesthesiolist had a mask on my face putting out a... wait, what's that really pleasant cool air in the pipe-- and I was out like a light.

## Awaking

I wake up briefly 4 hours later in an annex: my arm hurts so much and I wake up agitated. A nurse fetches a needle of Demerol and I fall asleep again. I wake up again later back in my room: it's dark outside, and I think a doctor briefs me that the surgery was successful

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}

{: refdef}

I try to be grateful, but I'm exhausted and on meds: it all feels very irrelevant and far away, but then the doctor says I have visitors. That catches my attention, and then I'm sleepily delighted to see my friends Eduardo and Andrea enter the room. There is scarcely a couple in the world who are better to awake to than these two gentle spaniards, and they are very sweet and stay for several hours to keep me company. I can't even hold down celebratory seltzer water in my stomach, but that's okay: they mostly just smile at me in the dimly lit room and I feel safe.

## Going Home

The next few days I combat a post-surgical fever, and I have my first mostly-forgotten meetings with my physiologists: I need to flex my hand as best I can. Andrea comes to visit me each day, and I also got to see Mei Yan, Maggie, and Lawrence. My body starts to relax after a few days and I feel healthier and healthier, although my arm is still held immobile in a sling.

Finally, on Wednesday the news comes that I am good enough to discharge from the hospital! Sacha from work comes to pick me up, and I step out into the humid Shanghai summer. It feels great! Ricky brings some groceries to my house, and Sacha helps me rearrange my place to be more left-handed and handicap-friendly. Xingguo is wonderful, although the garden has started to overgrow, and I cannot cut the weeds.

## Spaceship

The next week I'm mostly stuck indoors until I can start getting some function back in my arm: the swelling, bruising, and staples are pretty intense, and I have to babysit it pretty gingerly. My muscles are contracted to almost nothing, and I've not even the strength to lift my own arm for several days. Nelson came to help me change my bandage, and it was quite a Frankenstein sight:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Bruised and Stapled Arm]({{site.url}}/assets/broken_arm_undercast.png)
{: refdef}

After several days, I gained the superpower of being able to rotate my right forearm 90 degrees, meaning I can type on a laptop again. I look forward eagerly to return to work and feel like a productive member of society, a man, again. After a week of recovery, I limp to work unable to bear another day cooped up in my house. If I felt like I was drifting in space in a spacesuit at the hospital, my home was only marginally better: a spaceship in orbit. Returning to work was like a joyous landing back on earth.

## Back to Work

So that brings us to this blog post. It's been a week and a half since I've returned to work, and my recovery is going well. I can lift light items with my arm and don't need to walk in a sling anymore. My staples have been removed and the bruises have nearly gone away: the main hurdle now is to build up flexibility in my elbow, and that will be an ongoing process for several months, along with strength training. Hopefully I'll be back to my old self by October, 40cm of titanium and 16 screws heavier.

The experience has humbled me mildly, but it's mostly made me realize the value of friendship and family and competent doctors. I'd like to particularly thank Gabriel, Andrea, and Eduardo for being positive-energy sources when I needed it most; Doctors Dong (Surgeon), Wang (Doctor), and Hu (Anesthesiology) for my bionics; and to Ricky, Nelson, and Sacha for making logistics at my home much easier. My Mom also gets special last mention because of course. With them and everyone elses' help I hope to return 100% soon.

Finally: <b>GET AND MAINTAIN A GOOD MEDICAL INSURANCE PLAN</b>. I had to pay 6000$ out of pocket, but it'd've been 60,000$ if I was feeling too invincible for a plan. My work's insurance policy saved my ass and my arm, and this'd've been a tragedy if not for it.
