title : Thoughts On Powered Paper

What if I can stick an engine on a paper airplane?

## Background

One thing that struck me a week ago after giving a presentation about paper airplanes at [Barcamp](http://sewerbird.github.io/blog/2015/03/18/Barcamp%20Wrap-Up/) was that paper airplanes are gliders. 

>'Of course, silly'

Well yes, but the mental leap was to ask why can't paper airplanes have engines? Turns out they can, and there are a couple different approaches I might take to do so myself!

## XinCheJian

I've recently bought a membership to a local workshop called [XinCheJian](http://xinchejian.com/), which is essentially a space full of tools and electronics that you can use to cobble together whatever hobby project strikes your fancy. It's a nice alternative spot for me to work on things, and there are several interesting people working on equally interesting projects. I stick out a little bit, however, since I am not working on a project with a hardware component - I've been mostly programming while I was there, in between people soldering circuits and playing with lasers. This needs to be rectified!

My goal is to create a slip of plastic that you can place in the centerfold of your paper airplane. This slip of plastic would have a propeller powered by a tiny motor linked to a very small battery or perhaps capacitor. Ideally, I'll be able to make it so that the plane's propeller turns on when tossed and turns off when landed.

## It's Legit!

My friend Sean pointed out [PowerUp Toys](http://www.poweruptoys.com/), which has a smartphone-enabled controller on a similar device, including vectored thrust for turning. I figure my idea is a bit simpler and more humble in its scope, so I should be able to meet with success, despite my general inexperience with hardware components.

I plan to buy a few micro-parts offline from Japan and ship them here to Shanghai, and hopefully it'll cost less than a hundred or so Chinese Yuan (20-40 USD). I'll definitely post more about it as I go along!
