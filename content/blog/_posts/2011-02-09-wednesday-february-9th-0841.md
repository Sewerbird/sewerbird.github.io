New Year's was pretty fun: lots of fireworks and explosions again! I didn't do anything in particular though... mostly got lots of sleep, reading, walking, and gaming done. The weather's been progressively getting a bit warmer, and so it hasn't been as bitterly cold the last two weeks.<br /><br />I'm past the hump of my stay here now: under three months left, then I am back!
