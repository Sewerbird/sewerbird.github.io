Last night, I was surprised to discover I was being taken out to a fancy French restaurant with the other programmers by the Uberboss.


I had an exquisite steak and exquisite red wine (Bordeaux) at the excellent French restaurant in the old French Concession with amazing chocolate cake to top off the endless warm baguette slices with oil.


Yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.


And for free too!


We repaid the Uberboss by going to a nearby fancy bar and playing this vicious game of dice that made us all drink more than one should do on a Wednesday evening, and took taxis home. It was awesome!
