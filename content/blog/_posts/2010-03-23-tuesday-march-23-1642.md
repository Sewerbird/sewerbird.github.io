Hey!

I'm getting my wage doubled just because of how good my work is, and if they ask me to stay for two months longer, I am very very likely to be able to get a large bonus at the end, so I am quite pleased. =)


Also, I've been put in charge with the game design in general, so that's sweet. Yay for me, haha
