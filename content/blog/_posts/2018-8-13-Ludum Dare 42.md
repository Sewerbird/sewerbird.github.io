You can play the game [HERE](https://github.com/Sewerbird/LudumDare42) in your browser, or download it [HERE](https://sewerbird.itch.io/2954) for your computer.

## Background

In [a previous attempt]({{site.url}}/content/blog/coding/Ludum-Dare-40), I tried to create a game in 48 hours using [LÃ¶ve2d](https://love2d.org) and nothing else. Unfortunately, I was not able to complete it in time, and the result was not one I was very pleased with. This year though, would be different!

A major issue I had in the previous game jam was the lack of a proper set of 'base code' resiliant enough for the task. You see, in addition to choosing a game engine (the minimalist LÃ¶ve in my case), you are allowed to bring in some pre-written code to complete the task: but only utility code, not game code. Last jam, the pre-written code I brought in was simply not up to the task at hand.

So, for the past month, I've refined and practiced with some self-made code for drawing images on the screen. I took the time to make them interactable with the keyboard and mouse, have them be combinable into more complex images, allow them to serve as 'windows' for other images, and so on. I've also implemented a handy on-screen debugger, which makes finding errors in my code much easier: I can interactively query the internal states of game objects, without resorting to a bunch of 'print' statements in the game's log.

Armed with this and the use of [moonscript](https://moonscript.org) for quality-of-life improvements while coding, I reached Friday ready to go.

## Friday: Preparation

Although the Ludum Dare challenge didn't begin until 6am on Saturday, Friday was a vital day of preparation: I discovered in the last Dare how important it is to have your development environment all queued up and ready to go. So on Friday, I added an 'edit game state' ability to my debugger, which before could only 'query game state'. I also picked out a couple libraries off the internet I might want to use, although in the end I didn't have need of them. Finally, I made a point to join the [LÃ–VE2D Discord chat channel](https://discord.gg/rhUets9) and meet some folks: having online friends doing the same thing is a big help, and being able to fire off some quick questions in there ended up being helpful. 

I was in the COMPO category for this competition, meaning:

  - All game code must be made by myself
  - All game graphics must be made by myself
  - All game sounds must be made by myself
  - All game music must be composed by myself
  - ...and all of that must be made/composed within the 48-hour time period ðŸ’€

To fuel my efforts, I stocked my fridge with noodles and sandwich fixings, got several things of bottle water, and cleaned up my living room. I went out for a Poker Night with friends to relax, and took care not to get very drunk: a hangover would be a disaster for the Jam. I got home before midnight, and made plans to be awake at 7:00am, to see the theme: waking up at 6:00 seemed too early to wake up for. Lastly, I pre-wrote a to do list for the coming day, which planned out when I would take meals, breaks, and milestones for general came components.

## Saturday: First Half

At 7:00, I woke up bleary-eyed to the theme: **Running Out Of Space**. Whoo boy... I had been hoping for a *light/dark* theme, so was caught off guard by the topic. I got to brainstorming:

  - A "Snake" game? Seems really basic, but is almost offensively unambitious.
  - A "Galaga" game where the level gets smaller? A bit more fun to implement, but I think barely touches the theme.
  - ...many other 'shrinking level' ideas

Finally, I got some inspiration, and the folks on Discord thought it sounded fun as well: a puzzle game where you have a robot with limited harddrive space, and it has to move around the level picking up and ejecting diskettes, where each diskette lets it do something really basic (like move forward, turn left, and so on).

Idea in mind, I set myself to the task of explicit game design. I drafted a list of every single logical part of the game (map tiles, robot, diskettes, user interface buttons, inventory panel, and so on), and then further listed the programmatic and artistic requirements for each one. It was a big list! My biggest win here, in terms of foresight, was the decision to make the 'Inventory' panel double as a 'Command' panel: this halved the GUI I had to implement, gave me more screenspace, and kept the game 'all on one screen', which dramatically simplifies the code required.

Promptly at 9:00, two hours into my day, I typed my first bit of code. The plan was to rig up the User Interface first, starting with the Title Screen. The Title Screen was a good choice, compared to the Game Screen, since it was much simpler and forced me to think about scene change early on. This made sure I architected the game correctly for changing levels, and from experience I know that it's best to save the 'fun' work until last when under tight time constraint. Doing the title screen was boring, bug prone, and dry: but I was fresh, caffeinated, and spry!

By lunch, I had successfully gotten the title screen done. Most of the time was taken up by the Scene class code, and testing all the edge cases for swapping out. After a ham and cheese sandwich, I proceeded to work on the main game scene. This involved three major tasks:

  - Display a map view showing map tiles, the robot, and the diskettes
  - Displaying an inventory panel presenting the diskettes held by the robot
  - Issuing commands when a diskette was clicked, ejecting diskettes, and having all this auto-update in the map view

In the last Ludum Dare I did, this is where everything fell apart, but this time my judicious preparation of my `splat.lua` class resulted in a much easier time laying out all the visual elements of the game: my map view was properly culled, the buttons responded to input, and everything was able to communicate with each other effectively through eventing. This allowed me to get the map view to be 90% functional by the time 6pm rolled along, whereupon I had to go socialize with friends for the rest of the evening. I avoided too many tequila shots and managed to get home by midnight again to sleep.

## Sunday: Second Half

At 8:30, I woke up even more bleary-eyed than before: my sleep debt had been accumulating the past few days. Regardless, I was optimistic: my game was essentially functional, and all of today would be dedicated to polish. Polish such as... graphics. And sound. And actual levels to play on. You see, the state of the game at this point was this:

<figure>
  <img
   src="{{site.url}}/{{page.assets}}/screenshot2.png"
   alt="A lot of very functional, but totally opaque, colored rectangles."
   />
</figure>

Therefore, there was *lots* of graphical work to do today. I decided straightaway that I'd not bother to create real animations for the game: the time constraint was simply too much, for what was left to do. So after finishing the last two gameplay things I needed (picking up diskettes and victory detection), I opened up Affinity Designer and began to create graphical assets for everything. I am not a very good illustrator, but I managed to hack together a spritesheet sufficient enough to cover the basics. This took several hours, however, and the additional work writing up an asset importer meant that it was noon by the time I was able to have all the graphics imported into the game and being used.

After lunch, I set about to actually doing the 'Final 10%' of the game, which is always the hardest part. I started out by creating a level importer, and then designing the 5 levels I was going to include. This involved writing up files that looked like:

```
local level = {
tip = ">aku:: Click on items in your inventory to use your commands.\n>aku:: Click on your empty slot when over a command diskette. \n>aku:: Press the reset button up here if you get stuck!",
map = [[
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
E..@.....1....x
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
]],
robot = {facing=2},
slots = {
  capacity=2,
  {tag="PICKUP_0", command="FORWARD", image="forward"},
  {tag="EMPTY", command="PICK_UP", image="empty"},
},
pickups = {
  {tag="PICKUP_1", command="REVERSE", image="reverse"},
}
}

return level
```

This achieved after a few hours, I implemented an interstitial view to seperate levels and created a bunch of cute little sound effects with [Bfxr](https://www.bfxr.net). I found the 'mutation' button to be particularly useful, to subtly tweak a sound once I found one that was 'close' to what I wanted after using 'random'. Finally, I customized the Title screen, implemented a Credits screen, and added "Tips" to each level to help the player out a bit with the controls/gameplay. By the time I had all this done, it was time for dinner with my girlfriend, and watching some TV together.

Unfortunately, by the time the date ended, it was midnight: I still hadn't packaged up the game, and to make matters I realized that my game's theme song wasn't technically made by me, so I had to quickly figure out how to *COMPOSE MUSIC*. This was a major last minute task, since I had no software for it, no idea how to do it, and limited composer skills. Nonetheless, I pulled out a few bars and threw them into [Bosco.ceol](http://boscaceoil.net): a basic chiptune song that wasn't utterly offensive to the ears. By 2:30am, with the COMPO deadline looming (as well as a work day), I successfully built the game for Mac, Linux, and Windows, hosted it on [itch.io](https://sewerbird.itch.io/2954), and submitted it on the Ludum Dare website.

**DONE!**

## Monday: Retrospective

I am very pleased with the fact I finally made a full game from scratch in 48 hours, even while spending much time with friends out on the town. I think the time spent on my two helper classes (the debug console and the on-screen-splat class) was a key factor, as well as the expressivity of Moonscript. Chatting on the Discord with other people doing the Dare was also motivating and kept me from browsing Youtube and lollygagging around. It was also inspiring to see others' work, to give me a kick in my pants.

The game itself is quite solid, I think, and is very easily expandable with new levels and new diskettes. I intend to implement a JAM mode today after work and create a few extra levels. This mode will get unlocked after finishing the COMPO mode, which will remain unchanged until the judging period ends. I'd also like to submit a version of the game to the [A Game By Its Cover](https://itch.io/jam/a-game-by-its-cover-2018) game jam for the end of the month, after adding animations, many new levels, and a story told through the Tips panel featuring Unit:2845 and `aku`.

Once I am further away from this experience, I'll do a proper post mortem here, adding a section to the end of this post. Until then, stay tuned!
