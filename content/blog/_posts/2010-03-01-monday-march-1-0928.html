Had a nice laid-back weekend: went to English Corner and saw the last of the fireworks for a while I think, since Sunday was the lantern festival. Sadly, I didn't do anything for it, since I'm actually feeling a little under the weather the past two days: just a touch of a headache and the sniffles, so taking it easy and drinking water. I blame it on the fluctuating of the weather and mediocre air quality after two weeks of fireworks.
