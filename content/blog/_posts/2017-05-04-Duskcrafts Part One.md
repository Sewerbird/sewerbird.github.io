## Duskcrafts - Year One

I've returned to Dwarf Fortress after a long absence, and I'd like to share my playthrough with you! Follow the story of 'Duskcrafts' and hopefully see the construction of a great library of Dwarven Learning!

### The Starting Crew

The Quiet Corridors of the Rainy Fence set out to found a new fortress. Every founder of The Quiet Corridors is a monk in service to the dwarven gods, literate, and able to write.

- Brother Damoij: The dauntless, charming leader of the expedition, he'll also learn to hew the rock while his friends set up industry. He's also "Me" for purposes of this log.
- Brother Neugar: The barrel-maker and barrel-filler, Neugar has long been a friend and drinking buddy of Brother Hyakon
- Brother Siokal: Motivated more by civil-architecture and rock than by society, Siokal leapt at the chance to go to the frontier
- Brother Hyakon: Hyakon is an interesting guy: weaponsmith who enjoys fishing, and in a relationship with the studious Madame-Doctor
- Sister Kiokia: The green thumb, Kiokia runs the gardens and the kitchen!
- Sister Aikiak: A jeweler and craftsdwarfswoman who likes to help Kiokia during planting season
- Madame-Doctor Ililiya: The talented scholarly Ililiya keeps the books and minds the injuries of her good friends

### The Goal

Duskcrafts hopes to be a center of learning and scholarship for The Rainy Fence dwarven civilization. I will seek to make a very impressive library and chapel. I also hope for Brother Neugar to craft a brand of dwarven wine that will be as famous as the works of science and history crafted in the alcoves!

## Spring 125

Setting up on the foothills nearby the ancient ruins of Diamondglowed, I told the others to unpack the wagon as I carved out a temporary hobbit-hole into the rich red clay near the base of the hill. Sister Kiokia and Aikiak will start growing crops there soon, and Brother Neugar and Siokal will begin crafting furniture for us to use, while Siokal gathers plants away from camp: he's really quite unsociable! While they're down in the hobbithole, I'll begin excavation into a promising marble face further up the hill for where Duskcrafts will be built.

## Summer 125

Cresting the hills to the south, Dr. Ililiya saw a dwarven pair with a bunch of scampering littluns: her good friend Abai, her husband Moikaeb, and their five children! Along with them is Sister Aszum (Moikaeb's sister), who showed them the way. Sister Aszum has quite a reputation: although not as bookish as the rest of The Quite Corridors, she has some moxy: about 10 years ago she survived an encounter with the moonwoman Rakust Nightfate. Her mother is mayor of Rockstrade, and was a bard of some repute.

I've been carving out defenseworks around the trade depot in the building site of the fortress, setting up moats and mazeways and trade-good warehouses.

## Autumn 125

The merchants came, although we did not have much to trade: we asked for some livestock, cropseed, and an anvil for next year: we should be fine until then. Soon after the merchants left, some new friends arrived. Sister Aikiak's friend Sarvesh is here with her husband and child. Brother Neugar's old sailordwarf compatriot has come to help with setting up the Duskcrafts tavern. Sister Aszun and her brother Moikaeb's younger brother Doren has arrived with his two kids and his marksdwarf wife. Abai's older brother has come as well: so many family members are arriving to settle!

I've spent most of the season carving out the main craftshall within the entrance to the fortress. Brother Siokal put in some bridges in the defenseworks, although they aren't hooked up to levers yet to retract/raise. I earnestly hope to move everyone into the fortress by winterfall: we'll leave the hobbithole crops fallow and spend the winter setting up industry inside the fort.

## Winter 125

We've moved indoors, aside from our farm, and everyone has been moving their workshops indoors behind the main gate. No sooner had we set the beds up when the goblin Wereskunk Vispol Dotobendi ripped into our pasture, killing all of our livestock except two calves. Still unsated, he attacked and killed Abai, a devastating loss for her husband and five children. Turning back into a goblin, the Wereskunk ran off unpunished, and we mourned Abai's loss. The rest of the winter was spent sprucing up Duskcraft's rough walls and pondering what new dangers await us next year.
