It is snowy and wet today, and really quite cold. Toby will be coming back through Shanghai from Xi'An, so will have to find him a place to crash, since my new place doesn't have a couch. I think Jeff and Matt are able to put him up though, so that should work.<br /><br />Eugh... it's only Wednesday, hehe. At least there's Goth Night.
