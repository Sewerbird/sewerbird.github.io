Am in Hong Kong at the moment, in Tsim Sha Tsui, at an internet cafe looking up some things to do this evening.<br /><br />As always, Hong Kong is basically the coolest city I've been to this side of the Pacific. Definitely recommended for anyone looking for a vacation: no visa needed for the first 30 days, just need a passport, and it is a pretty epic little city.
