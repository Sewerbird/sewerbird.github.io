Happy New Year!<br /><br />I have lots of pictures from Beijing, but I am having difficulties with my thumbdrive, so they are still stuck on my laptop. Will keep trying to find a work-around. Beijing was awesome, although very very cold.<br /><br />On a related note, there is absolutely *NO ONE* at work today. I'm the only person in. I somehow feel like I didn't get a memo, but last time I checked, Jan 3rd isn't a holiday...<br /><br />Christmas: 25th Dec<br />New Year's Eve: 31st Dec<br />New Year's Day: 1 Jan<br />...<br />"I'm too drunk still" Day: 3 Jan?
