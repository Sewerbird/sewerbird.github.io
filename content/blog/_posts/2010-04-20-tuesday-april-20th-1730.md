It is impossible to find salted peanuts in China: only MSG ones. Although they taste alright, they bring a sweetness to the snack that I am not looking for when I'd much prefer an over-salty/dry legume.  At least you can get them de-shelled but still have that papery-brown membrane on the kernels.

This weekend, I'm going to ride out (rain permitting) to the ocean by Shanghai on my moped and see what it is like. I'll actively lower my expectations over the week though, because smart money says that the ocean probably looks as polluted as the Huangpu.


I've been playing a first-person shooter game called Counterstrike with the people at work: it's Artists vs. Programmers/Designers, and it is very fun to be able to shoot my bosses through the head with a semi-automatic.


Humidity, poor air quality conditions, and stagnant-feeling rain are causing mold to spring up into the air here in Shanghai, and so I've been struck with a kind of hay fever which has left me all stuffy. I've been taking care to air-condition my room (de-humidifies) and casually ride my bike (moving air) to ease the symptoms.
