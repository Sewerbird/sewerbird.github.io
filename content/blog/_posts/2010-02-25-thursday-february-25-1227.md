I find that whenever I am trying to pick up a new language (Latin, French, Chinese), that I end up spending more time on my own invented language instead. I think it's the same impulse where it's more fun to write something else instead of your school paper, or cleaning your room instead of the kitchen.

<b>English:</b> I should learn more Chinese.
<b>Jezzali:</b> Ec kadar calmi sena Cinu.
<b>Chinese:</b> Wo yinggai xuexi genduo Zhongwen.
