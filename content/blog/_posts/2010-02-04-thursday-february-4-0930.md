Ahoy!

Been working hard, but it's the kind of hard work you do when you are actually into the job, so am having a blast. It's still work, with deadlines and stuff, but I really do quite enjoy what I'm doing at the moment, and the people are cool. I'll try to take a picture of each of my friends in my next batch of alkaline batteries... I think I keep running out because I only ever take one picture every time I turn my camera on: I know the pictures I wanna take, and feel like the worst kind of tourist when I go around taking many photos at a go. 


Apparantly there is a big company dinner tonight, and those are always pretty ritzy (with Budweiser, it has to be classy...) and so that should be fun.
