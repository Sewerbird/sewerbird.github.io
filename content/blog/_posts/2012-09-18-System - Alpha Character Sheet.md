Today, I've come up with a character sheet for use during the game's alpha. My plan is to have some basic rules available for download this Sunday, so this is a sneak-peek of the general style I'm going for when it comes to the publication. For this blog, I have a personal goal to update every three times a week, and aim for Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday. Thursday's post will likely contain a preview of a part of the game's alpha rules, though I might just do a fun Character Option or Setting piece instead!

In any event, the character sheet is available <a href="http://jezzali.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Nendsame-Alpha-Character-Sheet.pdf">here</a>.
