Another day another dollar, although I will be putting together a cool simulation today, so I'm looking forward to that working.

Conducting my financial affairs remotely from China is a real right pain, primarily because of having to use an internet proxy (which makes online bank transactions very difficult to get verified) and the fact that such verifications require that I be available at a phone-line, but my phone being incapable of sending or receiving international calls. I have to jump through hoops everytime I manage a transaction back home. Ah well!
