Yay for Friday!<br /><br />I've cut my age in half and have been playing a bit of Pokemon recently. Reminds me of 7th grade, and it's still about as much fun =)<br /><br />I should really do something non-geeky some time soon: I think I'm approaching Geekical Mass:<br />  1. Game Designer<br />  2. Playing Pokemon<br />  3. Math degree<br />  4. General nerdiness<br />  5. Owns >5 portable devices, which in sum become unportable<br /><br />I think I'll buy, like, a Car Magazine or something just to atone?
