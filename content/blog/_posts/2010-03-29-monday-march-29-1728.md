Doing alright here: had a fun weekend walking around on a derive about Shanghai, but feeling too lazy to do a write up :-)

I'll try to put one together later tonight and post tomorrow maybe, but the summary is that I walked 14km in the wrong direction and ended up not seeing the Sea but instead the inland suburbs of Shanghai. It was interesting in its own way, though!
