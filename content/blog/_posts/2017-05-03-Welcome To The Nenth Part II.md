The Sakire are the people of Kyáhida, whose culture and daily life are far removed from our modern lifestyles. This post will cover the Sakire in more detail.

## Eating With The Sakire

Sakire have a diet that is mostly carnivorous - Hida bears no worthwhile fruits, and tasty seeds & tubers are unfortunately rare. As such, the diet is quite salty and oily, being composed mostly of fish, seafood, insects, and mushrooms. There are also analogues for honey, so sweet-tooths aren't doomed! These come from plant sap rather than bees though.

Although fish & mushrooms are easy to visualize, the crazy seafood is a bit harder. In addition to molluscs, scallops, and oysters, there are also chitinous invertebrates the size of large dogs, hairy crabs, enormous nautilae, and armored fish. There are also spiny urchins, seaweed, eels, and shrimp. A bewildering array of many-finned sharks and all the trilobites you can eat round out the Sakire diet.

Sakire are excellent net fishers, and can also engage in 'whaling' expeditions, although there are no whales - giant squid and massive sharks are the target of the harpoons. On shore, fresh seafood is enjoyed seasonally, with certain fish being smoked, salted, and/or honeyed for later. Sushi 'is a thing' as well, but most food is cooked over a fiery grill.

So far as terrestrial fare, worms are the primary dietary insect, often dried and salted as a snack. Wormpaste has a mild-sweet flavor that is quite nice as a sauce. Of note is a family of beetles that has a citric flavor if eaten fresh that is very popular: putting a handful of live ones in the mouth, chewing, then spitting out the shells is a prototypical kid's candy. Similarly, there are some ant-like insects that, when ground, have a taste like grapes mixed in soy sauce that is a common seasoning for squid, nautilus, and eel.

## Living With The Sakire

The Sakire of Kyáhida have a semi-nomadic clan society. Their camps on the rivers, in the forests, on the plains, and nestled in the highlands form a network of dwellings that are left mostly-abandoned most of the year, as families move together between them. Although not generally forming cities, the Sakire do have a few small permanent settlements. The most impressive of their settlements is Cezzebel, which constitutes the navel of the world.

## Cezzebel

The only true city in Kyahida, Cezzebel dwarfs all other settlements in the world: it has a bustling 15,000 permanent inhabitants, and twice that many Sakire merely passing through each season. Sakire come to the city to engage in trade, give birth, hold political referenda (called 'Moots'), participate in festivals, and worship at the High Temple. 

At the core of Cezzebel is The Remnant, where an enigmatic character lives: Makka.

## Makka

Makka is a seemingly immortal being who lives in The Remnant, an ancient structure not built by the Sakire. She seems very much like a Sakire, although she has two long horns coming from her head. Upon the death of a High Priestess, Makka will choose the High Priestess of the Ceke: the Makka'ya. Other than this ritual role, Makka does not interact much with the Sakire, although she's not entirely a hermit: she will sometimes deign to make a friendly appearance at festivals and moots.

The Sakire do not know her as such, but Makka is the Star Castellan of 192-Dviib: the star system that holds The Giant and Hida. She is also captain of the Ur-Kaci, a hopelessly damaged colony class ship. It lingers in orbit above, but succeeds in giving Makka a connection to her homecosm. If the Dear Reader were to visit The Nenth, they would likely meet quickly with Makka, who would be very interested in why someone so strange would come to visit her domain. She has only a small ability to control the malfunctioning rogue Colonizer Golems, and mostly uses this ability to set their priorities on the barren plains of Esoenska.
