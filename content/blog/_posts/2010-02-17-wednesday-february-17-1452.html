Sorry for the intermittence: it's a lot of trouble to get into the workplace during the holiday, so it is a pain to write up anything. I usually write them on my laptop and then transmit over the wireless to my work computer, but they've shut down the router. Doing well, and will give a nice summary blog for this week this monday, but I'm at the kindness of the janitor, hehe =)
