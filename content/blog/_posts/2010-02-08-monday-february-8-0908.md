Ahoyez Vous!

This weekend I did very little other than relax on the couch and programming/conlanging, since it was quite wet and no one was free to hang out. It was alright: I tried my hand at getting a genetic algorithm to work, and almost got it, except there is a bug I cannot seem to fix with my selection algorithm, which doesn't seem to work at all for some subtlety of reason beyond my capacity. Irritated, I just focused on thinking up all the verbal forms in Jezzali I could think of: I remember thinking to myself "Nah Ed, you won't need to bring <i>Describing Morphosyntax </i>by Thomas Payne to China, you can leave it here in Seattle".


It's always the book you don't bring... =\


Also, need to find if <i>Gormenghast</i> by Mervyn Peake is in any of the foreign bookstores, since I just finished the preceding book in the series.
