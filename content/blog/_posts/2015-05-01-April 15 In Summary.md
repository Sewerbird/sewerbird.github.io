This has been a pretty big month for me!

## Little Sad

I had been in a funk for a couple months: things weren't really going according to plan and I had a lot of distraction and anxiety taking up my days. Unemployed for a few months and the money running low, I felt I didn't have the mental discipline or vision to figure out what to do about things. Further compounding things was a crush I had on a friend of mine that was proving to be a source of much overthinking and so on. I needed a change - being 27 and being stuck alone & unemployed in China isn't how I imagine myself.

## Sunny Day Off

Luckily, my friend offered an invitation to come visit his house on March 30th to relax and meditate a bit - his house is tucked further away from the sounds of the omnipresent street life here in Shanghai, being as it is deep in a lane house complex: a warren of stories roughly 4 stories tall where laundry is hung out over the sunlit alleyways. Although it is easy to think of being unemployed as having every day as a 'day off', this would be an opportunity to really unplug and think on things. Having friendly company willing to wax philosophical also was an appealing notion.

So I rode out there, had a Pizza Hut breakfast with my friend, after which we spent most of the day contemplatively in his living room. I pondered a lot of things, going from the mundane to the numenal, a bit of introspection as well as a meditation on the concrete world around me. I allowed myself to experience anger I had ignored, to appreciate the texture of carpet, to see how boiling hot chocolate is like a primordial ocean, to appreciate the streetlife of China while sipping a beer, to mock the fakeness people can erect, to sympathize with the common struggle of man, to hear a bird sing, and all manner of things mundane and philosophical.

Day drawing to a close, and after a pleasant walk and dinner with my friend and his family, I took the subway home and went to sleep - the day ended up feeling exhausting despite the fact it was spent sitting on a couch and a quick visit to the convenience store for a beer. It was a proper day of work; work on myself.

## Denouement

The next day I told the object of my crush how I felt, and although she very sweetly and politely deferred, it felt like such a weight off my shoulders. (That said, I need to stop doing romantic things on April Fool's day - a story for another day perhaps)! I reapproached my life with renewed vigor, made an effort to network with my friends more aggressively, and landed a promising job interview within two days. I'm now employed and have spent the month trying to be more in-the-moment, more self-honest about my own reactions to stimulus around me, and feeling a bit more like a teenager - listening to metal music and not censoring myself.

It's been real liberating, and I'm very happy to be able to share my progress with you. I hope you've found a similar strength as I have in your own life, and if not, that you can find it too. Good luck!
