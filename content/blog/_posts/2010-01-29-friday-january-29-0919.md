Yay Friday!

I hope to go down to Huangpu District tonight and hang out near the Bund I think, and will try to take pictures. Sunday I'm doing English Corner again in People's Park, and I'm not quite sure what I'll do Saturday. I don't think I'll go out to the bar this evening: I'm trying to budget down so I can stow away some extra cash for Chinese New Year.
