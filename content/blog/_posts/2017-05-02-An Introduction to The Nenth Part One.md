I've been thinking a lot about a new revision of my world setting for the past two years, and have been building up enough details to start presenting it to the world: so here's an introduction!

## Background

For just about forever, I've had an ongoing project called 'The Nenth': a fantasy world. Its first (of many) incarnations was begun in my junior year of high school, in 2004. Ever since, The Nenth has been the default location for my creative projects: a backdrop and sandbox for whatever interested me at the time. It's changed dramatically over time, from a bog-standard medieval fantasy setting, to a surreal landscape, to a science-fiction setting, to its current state. 

The Nenth has been host to several paper & pencil roleplaying games, little stories, constructed languages, and thought experiments about biology, culture, and astronomy. In general, it's been a very fulfilling little thing to have lying around to 'adventure in', and I'm excited to share some of it with you!

## The Sky

One says 'The Nenth' as one would say 'The Universe', and in The Nenth there is a grand orb of whirling white clouds the size of Neptune. This maelstrom is called The Giant, the implacable father of the Nenth: tumultuous whorls swarm across his pale demeanor like angry moods, disrupting his blue-white face.

The Giant is pinned to the top of the sky, and every day he gobbles up the Sun. But the Sun is strong in times of trial, and struggles mightily within the belly of the Giant, so the Giant turns dark, red, and troubled until he vomits the Sun back into the heavens. Having been ungobbled, the Sun beats a retreat back home to the horizon to lick his wounds until the next day.

Beneath this heavenly drama is Hida: home.

## The World

Hida is a primordial land filled with flora and fauna different from Earth's. In some places, gangly Seussian trees fill up the forests of the mist-covered coasts, where water scorpions and enormous amphibians cavort. In others, grand pastures of green moss are punctuated by white columns of mushroom and teal lichen mats. Other parts have desolate lifeless sands of white talcum dust with salt rock protruding at unnatural angles. Our familiar trees, bushes, and flowers are not to be found, replaced instead by simpler and sometimes absurd replicae.

In the seas, great monsters and alien creatures exist, just like on Earth: mysterious wonders lurk in the depths, unexplored. Fish and sharks can be glanced, and a bounty of shellfish can be eaten if you can harvest them. Unnervingly, however, arthropods are just as numerous: enormous water-dwelling scorpions prey on fish and frogs, and can reach over a meter long in length. These too, can scuttle onto the land briefly, so take care!

Elsewhere, on land, the story is more quiet. There are many insects in the forests, and they can be quite large, but nothing larger than a skillet. The only threat to the Dear Reader is disease, venomous insects, and the mysterious rock Golems that lumber across the landscape like enormous elephants, engaged in unclear tasks. Stay out of their way, and they will leave you alone.

Away from the icy wastes and forbidding deserts you will find this place between land and sea, under the drama of heaven. It is called Kyáhida. And in Kyáhida you will find our kin in this land: the Sakire.

## The Sakire

The Sakire are the people of Kyáhida, and are very similar to you and me, although their culture and daily life are far removed from our modern lifestyles. They are a fit and active people who regularly travel between different parts of Kyahida by foot and boat, living a semi-nomadic life. Sakire have a culture that values humor and calmness, and (assuming you act with basic courtesy and appraoch their camp making lots of noise to announce your presence and intentions of peace) are surprisingly accomodating people. 

They do, however, have an initially startling physical trait which takes a moment to get used to: Sakire have a symbiotic relationship with a species of fungus, which resides in their skin where you and I would have melanin. As such, Sakire have a ghostly, stony, or ashy color, and will sometimes have lichen-growths near their joints and spine.

The next post will cover the Sakire in more detail.

## Makka

Makka is a seemingly immortal being who lives in The Remnant, an ancient structure not built by the Sakire. She seems very much like a Sakire, although she has two long horns coming from her head. Upon the death of a High Priestess, Makka will choose the High Priestess of the Ceke: the Makka'ya. Other than this ritual role, Makka does not interact much with the Sakire, although she's not entirely a hermit: she will sometimes deign to make a friendly appearance at festivals and moots.

Although the Sakire do not worship her, she is broadly acknowledged as an otherworldly being possessed of great power, to be appeased occasionally and respected always. Some Sakire believe she wards predatory Golems away from her abode, whereas others think she orders the golems' murderous rampages. Makka has been ambiguous about her relationship to the stony automata in the past, and the matter is left unresolved.

<div class="spoiler" style="display: none;">
The Sakire do not know her as such, but Makka is the Star Castellan of 192-Dviib: the star system that holds The Giant and Hida. She is also captain of the Ur-Kaci, a hopelessly damaged colony class ship. It lingers in orbit above, but succeeds in giving Makka a connection to her homecosm. If the Dear Reader were to visit The Nenth, they would likely meet quickly with Makka, who would be very interested in why someone so strange would come to visit her domain. She has only a small ability to control the malfunctioning rogue Colonizer Golems, and mostly uses this ability to set their priorities on the barren plains of Esoenska.
