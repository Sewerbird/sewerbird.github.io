Today I implemented some really basic groundwork for the game: a pannable map!

Since last post I've implemented the following issues:

- [Object Heirarchy](https://github.com/Sewerbird/Helios2400/issues/1)
- [Map Panning](https://github.com/Sewerbird/Helios2400/issues/2)
- [Debug Spritesheet](https://github.com/Sewerbird/Helios2400/issues/4)

Together, this is giving me the window you see above, a map view with three layers: terrain, cities, and units. Each hex and piece on the map possess the capacity to receive a click, have an art asset, and a world position. The drawing and clicking procedures of the games respect these bits, drawing each layer in an orderly fashion. The map view itself, as it stands, has a click capacity too: when you press down and drag with your finger or mouse, it will pan the world around as expected, nice and smoothly!

Although it isn't evident here, the clickable areas are arbitrary polygons, one polygon for each hex and piece. In the future, the 'areas' of the map needn't be hexagonal: they can be blobs much like on a [RISK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)) map.

## Next Steps

I'm a bit sick this week, so I'm not expecting too much to be done over the weekend unless I recover completely. However, high on my priorities is making units move from one hex to another: this will involve some pathfinding and interface work! You can keep track of my plans, as always, at [Github](https://github.com/Sewerbird/Helios2400/projects/1).
