Heya!<div><br /></div><div>Today is kind of blecch for weather, and just work really. In news, though, our lovely office assistant Tracey is leaving for a new job, and so today is her last day. It'll suck that she won't be around to help me talk to my chinese coworkers, but at least she gets to go be an art curator. I'll just have to pick up more chinese, haha. =)</div>
