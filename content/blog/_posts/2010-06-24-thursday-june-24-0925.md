I've been playing the original campaign of Neverwinter Nights to pass the time at home in the evenings: I've never actually finished it before. And man... it is a colossal game. Having spent what feels like a hundred hours on it, I'm just now halfway through it! I'm playing a elven Fighter/Thief, and am rocking a pretty mean longsword at the moment. I always play F/T because it is nice to just steamroll over encounters and pick up all the loot afterwards.

In the 'not spend China playing computer games department', it's been really muggy and uncomfortable out the past few days. Despite that, I've been going to the French, Italian, and German restaurants, and am really spending a little too much on the lovely food: I've developed a liking for red wine too. I still order Stella for my beer though.

A new programming intern guy has come out, so it's cool to have a new friend: his name is Matt and he's from Cambridge, England. He has a pretty thick Lennonesque accent, but we'll Americanize his speech eventually through peer pressure ;-)

We're about to finish a major development milestone for the game, so I'm excited to reset and approach the second phase with a fresh head. I'm thinking I might book a fast train to Beijing and see the tanks.
