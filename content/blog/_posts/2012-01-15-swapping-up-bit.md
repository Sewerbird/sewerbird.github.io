Decided to use the new books I've ordered (Eberron Campaign/Player Guides and Arcane Power): gonna rebuild Mia as an artificer, since I really like some of the abilities and I've enjoyed having her throw alchemical bombs all around the place more than cursing people. I'll also take the opportunity to rebuild Saribke a bit: same basic idea, but gonna have him try out a Bastard Sword and a Heavy Shield for a while, and choose some different powers for him.<br /><br />Main changes:<br />-Saribke and Mia will both be Mul's.<br />-Mia uses a throwing dagger instead of a pact blade, and is an artificer with weapon buff abilities and heavy use of alchemical items. She can help saribke out a lot more now, and can heal.<br />-Saribke switches to bastard sword and heavy shield, and is more 'physical' stat wise, so he can take some nice feats later in his career.<br />-Both are much more survivable: more HP, more surges, and more capability for resisting/healing themselves.<br /><br />Main things staying the same:<br />-Mia tries to stay behind Saribke and spams ranged attacks and grenades.<br />-Saribke is very mobile, tough, and does lots of push attacks.
