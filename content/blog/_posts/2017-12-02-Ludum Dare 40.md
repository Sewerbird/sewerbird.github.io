International game contest time! This page will serve as my development log of my progress over the next 48 hours!

## Explanation

I've decided to join in for the fourtieth [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com), an international contest to create a game in 2-3 days. Here's my log for the Compo event: a solo attempt within 48 hours, beginning at 10am Saturday, China Time. The theme for the competition gets revealed at that point, and I'll have to start essentially from scratch: making a finish product by 10am Monday. I'll be setting a personal deadline for Sunday at midnight, since I have work on Monday morning.

I will be using the [Love2D](https://love2d.org) game engine, along with some useful game-libraries I've hand-crafted over the past several months. Otherwise, all assets, content, and logic has to be done from scratch: even my handcrafted engine stuff is only half-ready, so I'm sure that'll be a significant source of stress!

I'm hoping for the theme to be amenable to some kind of board-game idiom, since that is what I'm prepared for. However, I'm prepared to swing over to a platformer or physics-based game if the winner theme is really not amenable to such: I did just make [Rocket Boy Redux]({{site.url}}/content/blog/coding/Rocket-Boy-Redux) after all!

## Activity Log

Here is my current status, in reverse chronological order.

### Saturday, 11:00 T+1:00

My second batch of brainstorming

- *Barista Game*, where the more customers in the queue you have the more hectic it is.
- *Bunny Farm*, where you have to raise then slaughter rabbits for market, but they're breeding faster than you can process.
- *Losing Conway's Game of Life'*, where you try to reach 0 live squares, but the game rules are tweaked for proliferation.
- *Multi Date*, where you have over-booked your date night and have to be at several tables in the restaurant and keep your dates happy.

Thinking more along the lines of managing complexity, I think my funniest idea is Multi-Date. The idea of a "Utter Cad" simulator would be funny to see, but I'm worried it is a bit too ambitious. After thinking on it a bit, I think it is doable though! Here's my sketch of the restaurant:

### Saturday, 10:30, T+0:30

My brainstorm ideas

- *"Get rid of your hand" style card game*. A bit basic, and not super exciting, but I could do it very quickly.
- *[Losing Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Losing_Chess)*. A bit traditional, but is an uncommon variant my code could handle quickly.
- *Airplane Routing game*. A bit hard to do, given I have to generate paths, and doesn't quite mesh with my existing basecode.
- *[Dodger]({{site.url}}/content/coding/Dodger) variant*, where I  imagine doing a version where you get more and more green dots to shephard around the field. I could even implement some basic flocking, where you eventually have a swarm that are autonomously avoiding the red dots while trying to follow your cursor. It would get harder and harder, since the swarm size would get bigger?'

I'm gonna give another half hour to brainstorming, and choose the Dodger variant if I can't come up with something better.

### Saturday, 10:00, T+0:00

<b>THEME: <i>The More You Have, The Worse It Is</i></b>

Alright, I saw this in the candidates list, and was semi-dreading it, as it's quite vague! I'm gonna brainstorm for the next half hour and think of what to do. There is a child at the space crying, so I may have to bail back home if the distraction is too much this morning.

### Saturday, 09:45, T-0:30

Arrived and set up at Coderbunker! Waiting on the theme, and it's just me doing the Dare at the moment. It'd be neat if some other hobbyists show up, but I'm prepared to do the whole thing alone.

### Saturday, 08:30, T-1:30

Awake and showered. I'm fixing up a breakfast sandwich and enjoying some quick internet browsing before I head off to [Coderbunker](www.coderbunker.com) to begin.

### Saturday, 00:15, T-9:45

Putting together this page for the log, and quickly pushing it to Github before heading to sleep. I've beefed up my Ludum Dare profile at [their site](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/$52664) with a logo, and have spent the evening trying to get my little bit of basecode to have a serviceable game camera. However, it's more important to get sleep now than to stay up fiddling it, so off to bed!
