International game contest time! This page will serve as my development log of my progress over the next 48 hours!

## Explanation

I've decided to join in for the fourtieth [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com), an international contest to create a game in 2-3 days. Here's my log for the Compo event: a solo attempt within 48 hours, beginning at 10am Saturday, China Time. The theme for the competition gets revealed at that point, and I'll have to start essentially from scratch: making a finish product by 10am Monday. I'll be setting a personal deadline for Sunday at midnight, since I have work on Monday morning.

I will be using the [Love2D](https://love2d.org) game engine, along with some useful game-libraries I've hand-crafted over the past several months. Otherwise, all assets, content, and logic has to be done from scratch: even my handcrafted engine stuff is only half-ready, so I'm sure that'll be a significant source of stress!

I'm hoping for the theme to be amenable to some kind of board-game idiom, since that is what I'm prepared for. However, I'm prepared to swing over to a platformer or physics-based game if the winner theme is really not amenable to such: I did just make [Rocket Boy Redux]({{site.url}}/content/blog/coding/Rocket-Boy-Redux) after all!

## Activity Log

Here is my current status, in reverse chronological order.

### Saturday, 22:00 (T+12:00)

Back at it! Thinking about the next thing to do, I need a proper way to animate the Cad moving from one tile to the next, the Dates walking to and from their tables, and the Taxi pulling up to and away from the curve. I think the simplest is the Taxi, so I'll work on that. I'll need to create an 'ease' function to smoothly animate the Taxi's motion, and then I can recycle that for the Dates and the Cad.

Lots to do this hour, so I'll try to ride a moderate Ballmer's Peak off this Hoegarden I bought:

   />
</figure>

### Saturday, 21:20 (T+11:20)

I think I need a power-nap. Gonna rest for 15 minutes, then grab a beer from the store.

### Saturday, 21:00 (T+11:00)

I decided to just push through the tiredness until the top of the hour, and managed to get a fun chunk done. There's a taxicab driving on the street now!'

- Create a Taxi class, as a yellow dot at the top of the screen on the Street
- Make Cad trigger a 'Tick' event on the message bus
- Subscribe Taxi to a 'Tick' event. This fires whenever the Cad moves
- Fix the columns and rows of the tilemap being flipped sideways
- OnTick, the Taxi moves down one tile
- If the Taxi goes hits the bottom of the screen, loop it to the top of the screen for now
- Forced the camera to sort the things it saw by Z coordinate: taxi made it apparent that the sprites were z-fighting when its darker transulcent street sprite hid it more effectively than the very light floor sprite.

   />
</figure>

### Saturday, 21:15 (T+10:15)

Oof... crashing a bit. Pondering if I should run caffeine this late, try to ride a Ballmer Peak, or just go for a brisk walk.

### Saturday, 20:00 (T+10:00)

A bit of a hump to get over: it's been 10 hours, and fatigue is starting to set in. I've been keeping up the momentum by doing some refactoring before continuing, since it's a bit easier on the brain:
'
- Moved several ad-hoc classes into own files for organization
- Create Date class, as pink dots
- Add first Date to map file

<figure>

   alt="Sparse screen showing an 'inside' box with a Red circle in it, Pink circle in it, then a sidewalk and street on the right side"
   />
</figure>

It doesn't visually look like much yet, but it's actually closer than you'd surmise to being a playable game.

### Saturday, 19:30 (T+9:30)

After a short break and a course of dumplings, I'm ready to go again. I would like to get the Dates begun at this point, since I've gotten the fundamental code for shifting the Cad around. I am a bit worried about my progress, but I think that's just jitters: if I can stay up tonight and stay relatively productive, then I think it's possible to get the fundamental game logic all done.

   alt="Sparse screen showing an 'inside' box with a Red circle in it, then a sidewalk and street on the right side"
   />
</figure>

### Saturday, 18:30 (T+8:00)

Wrapping up at Coderbunker, managed to get some board logic done:

- Make Tiles passable/impassable, depending on the type
- Require the Cad to only walk on passable tiles, not through walls

But it's been a proper sprint, so now I'll bike home and change into pajamas to code some more after dinner. I'm starving: the vegetarian lunch was good, but I think it was more salt and fiber than calories!

### Saturday, 18:00 (T+8:00)

Successfully got the board to not be random this hour:

- Make a Board layout function that takes in a map file. 
- The map file has a simple array with the Tile Type
- The map file has a simple list of Pieces, with their starting coordinate and some data

<figure>
  <img
   src="{{site.url}}/{{page.assets}}/ludum6.jpg"
   alt="Sparse screen showing an 'inside' box with a Red circle in it, then a sidewalk and street on the right side"
   />
</figure>

### Saturday, 17:00 (T+7:00)

I needed naive implementations (`O(pieces)` and `O(tiles)` is fine) for some basic board querying.

- Board support for `search(type)` to be able to get a list of `Tiles` or `Pieces`
- Board support for `search(type, tag)` to be able to search for specifically tagged pieces/tiles
- Board support for `search(type, tag, row, col)` to restrict search to a single tile, row, or column
- Board support for `search(type, tag, row, col, distance)` to restrich search to a rectangular zone around tile
- Make TheCad move by querying the Board for the Tile next to him, and properly attaching to the tile

I will need extra support for the Dates, but I need a change of pace: I'll work on making the Board layout an actual restaurant.

### Saturday, 16:00 (T+6:00)

Got the Cad listening to keyboard input. He moves himself, rather than using a general-logic 'move piece on board' command, but this will suffice for now.

<figure>
  <img
   src="{{site.url}}/{{page.assets}}/ludum5.gif"
   alt="Ugly mostly-blank screen with random slightly less badly drawn sprites, with a Red circle moving around"
   />
</figure>

Now, I'll try to add a notion of a 'Board'. Although everything has board coordinates right now, there's not a true notion of 'moving a piece by 1 space' or such, and I'd like to support queries like "Can I see the Cad" shortly for the Dates. Working on the Board class will also make it easier to layout the tiles in a logical (non-random) fashion.

### Saturday, 15:30 (T+5:30)

Now I'll start adding The Cad, and kind of get the graphics to stop being so eye-bleedingly bad. After a bit of tweaking, I have him as a Red Circle on the tilemap, whose tiles are shown without the awful scaling-down.

<figure>
  <img
   src="{{site.url}}/{{page.assets}}/ludum4.jpg"
   alt="Ugly mostly-blank screen with random slightly less badly drawn sprites, with a Red circle"
   />
</figure>

Next is to make the Cad move around in response to the keyboard. I'll do this by adding him to a piece and setting him to sit on one of the tiles. I'll then subscribe him to a keyboard listener, and find the tile next to him in the direction of the WASD/arrow keys.  

### Saturday, 15:00 (T+5:00)

My assets are pretty crap, but here is a set of stairs tiled in a grid:

<figure>
  <img
   src="{{site.url}}/{{page.assets}}/ludum3.jpg"
   alt="Ugly mostly-blank screen with random badly drawn sprites"
   />
</figure>

I promise it'll be better by Submission, but the main point is that I'm successfully rendering stuff.

### Saturday, 14:00 (T+4:00)

Finally have scene traversal for the camera working: now my game crashes because of no sprite to show, but that's actually a big improvement! I'll spend the next half hour making some quick assets for the restaurant.

<figure>
  <img
   src="{{site.url}}/{{page.assets}}/ludum2.jpg"
   alt="Splat doesn't have image exception"
   />
</figure>

### Saturday, 13:30 (T+3:30)

Finished Lunch: had a nice time chatting with Ricky, a salsa teacher, and some other programmers at the 'Bunker. Lunch consisted of tofu, egg, hummus, carrots, and shortbread. Now, I'll get the display bug to stop popping up, and hopefully show some Tiles in a grid shortly. Back to Work!

### Saturday, 13:00 (T+3:00)

The game's lose condition will be if a Date sees you on another Date, and you will get a Bronze, Silver, or Gold rating at the end of the night of dating based on how many Happy vs. Irritated dates leave in the Taxi. Each level will add more and more Dates per night, at quicker intervals, until the game becomes impossible. At the end of each night, you can decide to 'Call it Quits' and your High Score is the number of consecutive date nights with the same Date you have done, times her average Hearts upon leaving.

I've set up my local development environment, and need to start thinking about coding. I'm sat at my first bug right out of the box:

<figure>
  <img
   src="{{site.url}}/{{page.assets}}/ludum1.jpg"
   alt="First Stack Trace"
   />
</figure>

Lunch is being served now though, so will take a break for some vittles and company. It's apparently a vegetarian meal cooked by a guest cook at CoderBunker.

### Saturday, 12:30 (T+2:00)

Alright, gonna go with the "Utter Cad" simulator. You basically will have to manage hearts vs. impatience for each date, and move around in the restaurant such that you don't pass a date's table or be seen with another date. They show up over time in a taxi, and you have to seat them at tables throughout the restaurant and go on a date with them. After a certain amount of time, they will leave in irritation or to rendezvous with you later if you manage to keep their hearts higher than their impatience.

The game will consist of one scene, showing the floorplan of the two-story restaurant and the street outside. This will be a navigable tilemap, where each tile is one of the following:

  - *Floor* that you and your dates can walk on. Dates can see across floors in straight lines, and hear for 3 tiles.
  - *Walls* that you and your dates cannot pass. Dates cannot see through walls.
  - *Dividers & Plants* that you and your dates cannot pass. Dates cannot see through dividers, but can hear through them.
  - *Sidewalk* that dates will wait on outside after arriving in/waiting for the taxi. 

There are 3 kinds of pieces in the game:

  - *The Cad* is you, and your main playing character. You can move freely, although you must successfully make an excuse to leave a table that has a Date at it.
  - *The Dates* are your dinner companions for the evening. They will show up periodically in a Taxi and wait outside until you go meet them or send a text message for them to go to a particular table. They will then stay at the table until they get Irritated (where they will leave the restaurant), Restless (where they will go to the Women's bathroom and come back), or see/hear you on another date (where they will run up to you and cause Game Over). Dates who have maxed out their Hearts can be escorted by The Cad to the restaurant entrance for a smooch, then sent away in a cab.
  - *The Patrons* are other restaurant-goers whom you have no interaction with. They are very annoying in that they will take up unused tables at random, complicating your Date placement. They do, however, block line-of-sight to The Cad for The Dates
  - *The Taxi* carries your dates to and from the restaurant, outside on the street

The game will proceed in time ticks, and each tick the following happens

  - If the Taxi is Offscreen, it has a 10% chance of coming Onscreen, and a 5% chance of having a new Date.
  - If the Taxi is Onscreen, it moves down a tile if not on the DropOff tile
  - If the Taxi is Onscreen and on the DropOff tile and its WaitTimer = nil, it sets its WaitTimer to 5 minutes
  - If the Taxi has a Date, the WaitTimer is set to 10 seconds and the Date is moved onto the Sidewalk
  - If the Taxi is Onscreen and on the DropOff tile and is Empty and its WaitTimer = 0, then it moves down a tile
  - The Cad may move to an adjacent Floor if no Dates are Engaged
  - If a Date is Engaged,
    * ...the Cad may Excuse Himself, causing the Engaged Date to Sit Back
    * ...the Cad can Be A Gent, increasing the Engaged Date's Hearts
    * ...the Cad can Be A Dick, increasing the Engaged Date's Irritation
    * ...the Cad can Be A Bore, decreasing the Engaged Date's Hearts'
  - All Dates check their environment to find The Cad, unless they are Looking At Phone
    * If the Cad enters view, they Sit Up, expecting the Cad to approach
    * If the Cad leaves view while Sitting Up, the Date gets quite irritated
    * If the Cad is sat at the same table while Sitting Up, the Date becomes Engaged
    * If the Cad is seen with another Date, Irritation goes to max and Hearts goes to min, and the Date stands up and plots a course to the Cad. Game Over flag is queued.
    * If the Cad leaves view while Sitting Back, the Date remains Sitting Back
    * If the Cad is not in view, Irritation increases slightly
    * If the Cad is not in view, the Date has a 50% chance of Looking At Phone
    * If the Cad is sat at the Table, the Date immediately becomes Engaged if Looking At Phone
 - If the Date is in the Women's Bathroom and Standing Up with no next move, she Freshes Up
 - If the Date is Engaged, then her Restlessness goes down
 - If the Date is Sitting Back, then her Irritation and Restlessness go up and her Hearts go down
 - If the Date is Standing Up, she will Move to the next tile on her path
 - If the Date is Freshing Up, her Restlessness goes down.
 - If the Date is Looking At Phone, then her Irritation goes up and her Hearts go down
 - If the Date's Irritation maxes out, she will Stand Up, call a Taxi, and plot a course to the Exit
 - If the Date's Restlessness maxes out, she will Stand Up, and plot a course to a free sink in the Women's Bathroom
 - If the Date's Restlessness is at minimum and she is Freshing Up, she will Stand Up and plot a course to her table
 - If the Date's Irritation is Maxed and she is On The Street, and there is an Empty Taxi, she enters the taxi

I'll spend a bit more time figuring out the win/lose conditions, and then I'll start hacking together the first bit of code for displaying the Tilemap. My library is a bit broken, so I'll have to correct it's "Camera" code before I can start coding.

### Saturday, 11:00 (T+1:00)

My second batch of brainstorming

- *Barista Game*, where the more customers in the queue you have the more hectic it is.
- *Bunny Farm*, where you have to raise then slaughter rabbits for market, but they're breeding faster than you can process.
- *Losing Conway's Game of Life'*, where you try to reach 0 live squares, but the game rules are tweaked for proliferation.
- *Multi Date*, where you have over-booked your date night and have to be at several tables in the restaurant and keep your dates happy.

Thinking more along the lines of managing complexity, I think my funniest idea is Multi-Date. The idea of a "Utter Cad" simulator would be funny to see, but I'm worried it is a bit too ambitious. After thinking on it a bit, I think it is doable though! Here's my sketch of the restaurant:

<figure>
  <img
   src="{{site.url}}/{{page.assets}}/IMG_9919.jpg"
   alt="First restaurant sketch"
   />
</figure>

Now I'm gonna work out how what the game rules are.

### Saturday, 10:30 (T+0:30)

My brainstorm ideas

- *"Get rid of your hand" style card game*. A bit basic, and not super exciting, but I could do it very quickly.
- *[Losing Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Losing_Chess)*. A bit traditional, but is an uncommon variant my code could handle quickly.
- *Airplane Routing game*. A bit hard to do, given I have to generate paths, and doesn't quite mesh with my existing basecode.
- *[Dodger]({{site.url}}/content/coding/Dodger) variant*, where I  imagine doing a version where you get more and more green dots to shephard around the field. I could even implement some basic flocking, where you eventually have a swarm that are autonomously avoiding the red dots while trying to follow your cursor. It would get harder and harder, since the swarm size would get bigger?'

I'm gonna give another half hour to brainstorming, and choose the Dodger variant if I can't come up with something better.

### Saturday, 10:00 (T+0:00)

<b>THEME: <i>The More You Have, The Worse It Is</i></b>

Alright, I saw this in the candidates list, and was semi-dreading it, as it's quite vague! I'm gonna brainstorm for the next half hour and think of what to do. There is a child at the space crying, so I may have to bail back home if the distraction is too much this morning.

### Saturday, 09:45 (T-0:30)

Arrived and set up at Coderbunker! Waiting on the theme, and it's just me doing the Dare at the moment. It'd be neat if some other hobbyists show up, but I'm prepared to do the whole thing alone.

### Saturday, 08:30, T-1:30

Awake and showered. I'm fixing up a breakfast sandwich and enjoying some quick internet browsing before I head off to [Coderbunker](www.coderbunker.com) to begin.

### Saturday, 00:15, T-9:45

Putting together this page for the log, and quickly pushing it to Github before heading to sleep. I've beefed up my Ludum Dare profile at [their site](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/$52664) with a logo, and have spent the evening trying to get my little bit of basecode to have a serviceable game camera. However, it's more important to get sleep now than to stay up fiddling it, so off to bed!
