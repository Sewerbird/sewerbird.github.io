# Campaign 2020

Welcome to a new year, everyone! I'm looking forward to running a new D&D campaign for you, and am grateful for your setting aside the time to play!

- __WHERE__: Ian & Ashurri's House
- __WHEN__: Saturdays at 7:00, until 10ish
- __WHO__: Any of Ashurri, Braedon, Cody, Gabe, Ian, and Joe

## Instructions

- Create a level 3 character using any combination of official D&D sources.
- If you have a campaign reward card from last time, you can apply it to your character.
- Bring your character sheet, dice of some kind, and tools for taking notes.
- Your character has been adventuring with the party for a while: why are they your buddies?

## Overview

The setting is typical medieval fantasy, taking place in an alternate-history 10th-century Europe. Fantasy races are common, having lived in Europe since the time of the ancient Egyptians, who accidentally created a portal at Giza. Specifically, the town of St. Mojito will be where it takes place, located near the site of real-world's Split, Croatia.

This campaign will be structured a bit differently from last year's:

- It will be __sandbox__. As a DM, I will be putting more effort into creating characters than making story plots: the story will emerge out of you interacting with NPCs who have their own agendas, hopes, and needs.
- It will be __episodic__. For most of the campaign, the goals will be bite-sized: a 'main quest' won't dominate everything, but be worked on as you please. Adventures begin and end in St. Mojito, making it easier for people to 'miss' a game session and still be caught up.
- It will be based around a __stronghold__. The adventures in this campaign will all fall within 10 miles of St. Mojito's town square. As such, it makes sense for you and the party to invest heavily into the town: you can buy property, create a guild, build relationships with NPCs, and so on without worrying about it being 'wasted effort'. You will 'win' the campaign by having built up yourself and the town enough to withstand threats from beyond.

## Briefing

After a recent string of successful adventures with your party, The Empire has awarded you with a paid trip to the medieval beach resort of St. Mojito. Your fame and prowess are great assets, and The Empire is hoping that if they treat you well, they can keep you near the town and make the province a better place. 

St. Mojito is a medium-sized town of about 3000 inhabitants, located on an ocean coast. A coastal mountain range rises up quickly behind it, coated in dense forest. St. Mojito is a town in The Empire, a huge nation bordered to the north by barbarians, and to the south-east by Al-Saraca, a rival empire. 

You will begin the campaign on the beach of the Sun Tiger Resort, located on the southern tip of St. Mojito's downtown coastal bay.

You are currently a couple days into your stay at the local beach spa, well-rested and feeling very lazy. At some point in the coming week, the Major of St. Mojito would like to meet you, and discuss possibilities for working together. Until that point, however, you have the run of the town. That is, if you can pull yourself away from the beach, sauna, and bar.
