**The Remnant** is an enormous megastructure whose purpose is truthfully unknown ot the [Sakire](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Sakire), however there are several good guesses. It is obviously mand-made, and [Sakire](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Sakire) are pretty sure its construction coincides with or predates [Sakire](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Sakire)'s beginnings on the planet. It points up to the sky towards [Rael](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Rael) and is actively guarded by fell metallic beasts called [Golems](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Golems) and a miasma that drives men insane. The structures beside the remnant are massive as well, but habitable (the city of [Jeze](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Jeze)).

The remnant shows occasional signs of activity, the most dramatic being its controls of the [Godsgate](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Godsgate) and the [Six Spigots](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Six_Spigots), which control the river and marshlands' levels. The [Golems](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Golems) are quite closely monitored from a distance, since they infrequently make destructive sorties into [Jeze](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Jeze).

The [Ceke](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Ceke) theory is that the [Gical](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Gical) lives in the structure, which serves as his palace. Sakiriste priests instead say that the remnant is the cradle of all [Sakire](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Sakire) and is itself a living organism. Truthfully, they are both half right, but ascribe too much cosmic centrality to the remnant - it is a fortified colonization beacon and manufactory that is in Lockdown after a semi-aborted automated colinization by the [Sakire](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Sakire)'s ancestors. The mothership is literally in orbit at the sub-[Rael](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Rael)ian lagrange point directly above the remnant.

The only living resident of the Remnant is [Makka](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Makka). This decade she's been a recluse, but has often sortied out to see what's up in the broader world

Because of its well delineated fortification and perfect control of the waterworks, actual [Sakire](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Sakire) interaction with the remnant is small - it is an enigmatic and evocative monument that ominously points to space.
