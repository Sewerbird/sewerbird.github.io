**Golems** are the mechanical automatons associated with [The Remnant](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/The_Remnant), and are much feared by the Sakire.

! Origin

Golems primarily fulfill the purpose of carrying out manufacturing, maintenance, and scavenging, and security tasks. Golems are extremely hostile to Sakire trespassers and mete out swift unblinking destruction.
