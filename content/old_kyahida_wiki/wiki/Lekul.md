The **Lekul** ('School') are any association formed with a recognized legal identity. Lekul can function as cults, trade unions, cartels, guilds, and even criminal organizations. 

A Lekul must be formed of at least three individuals of three different [Nanike](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Nanike), be ratified by the [Lord Chair](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Lord_Chair) or a [Moot](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Moot), and pay a yearly tithe to the Ceke. In return, the Lekul may appoint a representative to Moots in which they have a concern: as such, they are able to lobby for their business and often secure certain privileges for their members, most typically in the form of sanctioned monopolies and trade guarantees.

The Lekul are geographically constrained by the jurisdiction of their ratifying agent: a local Moot can only appoint a local Lekul, and a Lord Chair can only appoint a Lekul for their own Graizi. The Grand Moot has succeeded in appointing a few universal Lekul, primarily in the form of military and legal orders associated with the functions of the Ceke.

The ratifying agent can dissolve the formed Lekul, although occasion for this is uncommon. More common is a 'probation' that bars the Lekul from sending representatives to a Moot or benefiting from granted privileges for a determined time. This is done to punish badly-acting Lekul or to solidify the power of the ratifying agent.
