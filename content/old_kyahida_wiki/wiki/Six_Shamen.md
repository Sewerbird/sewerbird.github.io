The **Six Shamen** were a coalition of rulers who, together, controlled the cities of [Jeze](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Jeze) (then called 'Rica') and [Rela](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Rela). They were toppled by [Jeze the Immortal](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Jeze_the_Immortal), who emerged predominant in [The Old Shudder](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/The_Old_Shudder) war.
