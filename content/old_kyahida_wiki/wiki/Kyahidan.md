The language of the [Sakire](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Sakire) is called **Kyahidan**, and features about six regional dialects.

[Kyahidan](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Kyahidan) is, aesthetically, somewhat of a cross between Chinese and English - it is a tonal language that eschews Mandarin's plethora of affricates for English-like consonant clusters. Of note grammatically is a diverse set of measure words and extensive use of serial and phrasal verb constructs.

[Kyahidan](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Kyahidan) is a written language as well, employing a hybrid logographic/alphabetic script. Words in open word classes are spelled out phonetically, but words in closed classes almost always have logograms.
