The **Ceke** is the highest authority of Kyáhida and, as an institution, is charged with conveying and enacting the plans and goals of the Ancients. The shape of the Ceke has changed over time, but the broad strokes have remained the same since antiquity: the Ceke is composed of a religious bureaucracy in [Jeze](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Jeze), a [Moot](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Moot) occurring 2-4 times a year, and the [Lord Chair](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Lord_Chair) of Jeze being appointed Ultimate Arbiter and Castellan of Kyáhida. In recent history, the Ceke has seen the formal elevation of the [Fùkan](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Fùkan) of the Balcony Court from an advisory to a judicial role, under the doctrine of [Kicabisme](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Kicabisme).

The Ceke derives its authority from a social agreement amongst the Graizi. Because [The Remnant](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/The_Remnant) is the primary site of pilgrimage and the abandoned structures nearby provide such enviable housing for Sakire, Jeze is considered a special place that will always be the inevitable prize for the [Ceke Lords](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Ceke_Lords). After a particularly bloody decade of internecine war, [Jeze the Immortal](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Jeze_the Immortal) defeated the [Six Shamen](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Six_Shamen) of Rica (Jeze's name before his conquest). Shortly into his reign, she declared a Moot of Moots and instated The Ceke via the famous Edicts and Allowances.

## The Edicts of Jeze

The Edicts were the terms set down by Jeze the Immortal without compromise, and were dictated to the Ceke Lords at the beginning of the first Grand Moot.

* The Lord Chair of Jeze is the inevitable Gical and Ultimate Arbiter & Castellan of Kyáhida.
* All Lord Chairs and their Graizi are vassals of the Gical, and must pay tribute
* The Lord Chair of Jeze has authority to call a Moot of Moots in Jeze, which all Ceke Lords must attend
* ....
* ....


## The Allowances of Jeze

The Allowances were the compromises reached between Jeze the Immortal and the Ceke Lords of the first Grand Moot to facilitate broad acceptance of the Edicts of Jeze.

* The Lord Chairs have ultimate authority to call a Moot of the Graizi in their domain and may appoint their own deputies.
* ....
