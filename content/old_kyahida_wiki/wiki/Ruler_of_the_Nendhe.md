The **Gical** is a concept that underpins the authority and legitimacy of the [Ceke](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Ceke) - if there were incredibly power predecessors that brought Sakire to the [Nendhe](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Nendhe), then who did they leave in charge when they left? The answer of the Ceke Court (and [Kicabisme](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Kicabisme)) is that [The Remnant](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/The_Remnant) appoints through its trials a regent, a Gical, until the predecessors return.

## Overview

Although the Emperor of Kyahida is considered to be the Ceke Lord of Jeze, the current system invests ultimate symbolic power in the Balcony Court, a spot in The Remnant safely accessible to the Sakire. This Balcony overlooks a small plaza where the Gical can be thrown food and conversed with relatively safely - a platoon of deadly Golems oversee the plaza, prohibiting descent of Sakire down from the balcony.

The motions and mad ramblings of the poor Sakire trapped below the gaze of the Balcony are interpreted by the Fùkan, a group of seers and diviners, for portents of the future. The Gical, enthralled by the [Remnant Vision](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Remnant_Vision), is considered to be a 'slave-king' in charge of relating the whims and directives of the ancients. 

There is only ever one Gical: there is a chute down which a Sakire will infrequently come tumbling into the plaza, and the existing Gical will typically try to dismember and eat the newcomer. If the newcomer survives and kills the current Gical, they become the new Gical. Six times in recorded history there have been two Gical in the plaza, although the situations were always temporary. Most of these times, the two Gical were of opposite sex and either rape or a sexual relationship occurred. However, each of these times, one partner killed the other within a week, often in their sleep.

## Controversy

The belief that the Gical is a position of insane regency is disputed widely: the doctrine is preeminent now primarily because this was the belief held by [Kicab Ast Nanike](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Kicab_Ast_Nanike), the conqueror who defeated [Jezzaila III](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Jezzaila_III) and brought in the current Empire Kyáhidan. In times past, the [Lord Chair](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Lord_Chair) of the city of [Jeze](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Jeze) was considered to be the primary Graizi, and whomever could conquer it was considered preeminent and legitimate Gical. This is the primary doctrine of the [Sakiriste](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Sakiriste) sect. Although not a forbidden position, it is primarily held by dissidents and conservative elements of society.
