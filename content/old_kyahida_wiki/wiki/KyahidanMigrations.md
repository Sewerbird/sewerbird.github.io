Most [Sakire](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Sakire) live in the open wilds of [Kyáhida](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Kyáhida) in nomadic bands. However, each band usually remains in a range - usually within one or perhaps two [Graizi](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Graizi). More sedentary [Sakire](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Sakire) will establish Kandre compounds in the nearest town or city.

However - all [Sakire](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Sakire) make pilgrimages to [Jeze](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Jeze) several times in their lives, often yearly. This is because of political, economic, and religious reasons. Every year in [Jeze](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Jeze) is a massive festival coinciding with the winter Ceke [Moot](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Moot) - held in winter, the Moot sees [Jeze](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Jeze)'s population double with visitors from abroad, being the largest seasonal migration of [Sakire](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Sakire) on the planet.

The festival is a big economic boon for [Jeze](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Jeze), although the politics and ribald festivities usually mean [Jeze](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Jeze) is on fire a good portion of the time. Historically there have been some vicious urban wars waged on the streets of the city during the moot. On the other hand, a smooth moot that is still festive is a mark of great prestige for the [Ceke](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Ceke).

[Kica](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Kica) and [Rela](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Rela) try to attract similar business in spring and fall respectively, but aren't as popular. If [Jeze](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Jeze) has a bad Ceke Moot, however, these secondary destinations benefit for a couple years.

Religious migrants, as well as the people of [Sairo](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Sairo), traditionally come to [Jeze](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Jeze) by foot along the river entrance, but the easier way in is by boat from the sea.

[Nanike](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Nanike) ties are quite strengthened by gatherings like these, and each [Nanike](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Nanike) maintains neighborhoods in these large cities for lodging, administration, and trade.
