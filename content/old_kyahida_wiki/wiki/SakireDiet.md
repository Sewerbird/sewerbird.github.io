[Sakire](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Sakire) have a diet that is mostly carnivorous - the planet hasn't evolved fruits, seeds, or much in the way of tubers unfortunately. As such, the diet is quite salty and oily, being composed mostly of fish, seafood, insects, and mushrooms. There are also analogues for honey, so sweet-tooths aren't doomed! These come from plant sap rather than bees though.


! Seafood

Although fish & mushrooms are easy to visualize, the crazy seafood is a bit harder. In addition to molluscs, scallops, and oysters, there are also chitinous invertebrates the size of large dogs, crabs, enormous nautilae, and armored fish. There are also spiny urchins, seaweed, eels, and shrimp. A bewildering array of many-finned sharks and all the trilobites you can eat round out the [Sakire](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Sakire) diet.

[Sakire](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Sakire) are excellent net fishers, and can also engage in 'whaling' expeditions, although there are no whales - giant squid and massive sharks are the target of the harpoons. On shore, fresh seafood is enjoyed seasonally, with certain fish being smoked, salted, and/or honeyed for later. Sushi 'is a thing' as well, but most food is cooked over a fiery grill.

! Insects

So far as insects, worms are the primary dietary insect, often dried and salted as a snack. Wormpaste has a mild-sweet flavor that is quite nice as a sauce. Of note is a family of beetles that has a citric flavor if eaten fresh that is very popular: putting a handful of live ones in the mouth, chewing, then spitting out the shells is a prototypical kid's candy. Similarly, there are some ant-like insects that, when ground, have a taste like grapes mixed in soy sauce that is a common seasoning for squid, nautilus, and eel.
