The **Ur-Kaci** is the starship that brought the [Sakire](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Sakire) to [192-Dviib](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/192-Dviib). It is Colony-class, but boasts a Cruiser-class defense array. It sits in orbit above [The Remnant](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/The_Remnant) at the first lagrange point of Rael and Nendhe.

The colony mission has gone awry, due to an automation failure and disastrous malfunction of the manufactory (the Remnant), so the payload of embryonic Sakire live in their current low-technology state. Although initially the Ur-Attendant [Makka](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Makka) was devastated, the hidden and distant nature of [192-Dviib](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/192-Dviib) from other Ur-Attendants provided an interesting opportunity to 'start from scratch', especially for an immortal of Makka's temperament.

The Ur-Kaci can be seen with a keen eye at certain times of the day but, due to its positioning, is considered an odd feature of Rael, rather than an entity in between. However, Sakire interest is spent more on the undulating cloud patterns of Rael rather than the meagre speck of Ur-Kaci.
