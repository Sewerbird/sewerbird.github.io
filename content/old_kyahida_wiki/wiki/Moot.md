The institution of the **Moot** is one of the oldest in Ky√°hida. Kandre are obliged to to avenge injuries against their members, but this can lead to eye-for-an-eye spirals of anger. A balancing structure was necessary to reduce feuds amongst the Nanike and avoid social disorder, and so the Moot was developed.

A Moot is an assembly of the Sakire of a locale, Graizi, Nanike, or Lekul. There are consequently hierarchies of Moots, so that the local moots are represented at the higher-level moots. At a moot, disputes are solved and political decisions are made. The place for the moot is often also the place for public religious rites, and almost always is a site for commerce.

Moots meet at regular intervals, make laws, elect officials and Ceke Lords, and judge according to the law, which is memorized and recited by a Planeswalker. The moots negotiations are presided over by a Sasemine and the appropriate Ceke official - the prototypical Graizi Moot therefore is presided by the Ceke Lord, whereas local moots by the preeminent Kandre master.

Although in reality the Moot is dominated by the most influential members of the community, the heads of Kandre and powerful families, but in theory one-man one-vote is typically the rule.

There are three levels of meetings called moots, arranged in a heirarchy: lower moots send delegates to higher moots as required.

## The Ceke Moots
The Ceke Moots are the highest assembly in the land, and occur once every season to resolve disputes and affairs concerning multiple Graizi and universal law. Two are held in Jeze (one in Winter, one in Summer), and the other two are held in Rael and Kica (Fall and Spring respectively).

Ceke Moots are presided over by the Nanike Lords in the presence of the Kicab and the Ceke Lords. The mootmen involved are delegations sent from each Graizi.

## The Graizi Moots
Graizi Moots are the intermediate assembly of the land. Such moots are convened as necessary to legislate, elect Ceke Lords, assemble armies, and settle territorial disputes. Graizi Moots are presided over and convened by the Ceke Lord. The mootmen involved are the heads of Nanike in the Graizi, as well as those individuals invited according the the particular customs of the region.

## Local Moots
Local moots resolve disputes and settles affairs in a small area, and are fairly informal. A well-liked Kandre leader or respected elder will convene a moot as necessary. All Sakire of sufficient interest in the affairs at hand may participate.
