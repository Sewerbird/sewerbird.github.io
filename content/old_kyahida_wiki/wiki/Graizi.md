A **Graizi** is an administrative, geographical, and cultural unit of Ky√°hida, and is formally defined as the region under the authority of a [Lord Chair](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Lord_Chair). Graizi can be thought of as vassal kingdoms, with each nominally deferring to the authority of the [Ceke](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Ceke). As such, it isn't uncommon for Graizi to be at war/conflict with their neighbors.
