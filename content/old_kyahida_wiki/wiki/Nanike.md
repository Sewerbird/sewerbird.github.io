A **Nanike** is an entity that can participate in Moots, either Graizi or Ceke, and is ultimately responsible for safeguarding the interests (property and wellbeing) of its members. Because Sakire consider themselves to be subjects of one particular Totem each, this has been grafted onto the Nanike concept. Because totems are a-geographical and the rules associated with who is who, Nanike membership as a consequence unites disparate Kandre.

Although all Kyahidans inhabit Graizi, this citizenship is mostly overriden by loyalty to one's Kandre, and each Kandre has a Nanike affiliation.

The predominant continuing factor in Nanike's stability comes from the ability to see constituent Kandre often, at the Ceke Moots held every other season or so, particularly the Jeze Moot. All Nanike have complexes in Jeze, and also in Kica, Rela, and Sairo. Other smaller cities will have members of each Nanike, but not necessarily Nanike complexes.

Importantly, it is worth nothing that Nanike tend to have political power whereas [Lekul](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/Lekul) will have a steering/lobbying influence based on the local economy, particularly in cities. Nanike are strongest among nomadic Graizi, but the Lekul begin to hold great sway once considering urban Sakire.

There are thirteen great Nanike:

* [House Lekr](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/House_Lekr) - "Nautilus"
* [House Sanik](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/House_Sanik) - "Trilobite"
* [House Ast](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/House_Ast) - "Beetle"
* [House Daith](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/House_Daith) - "Clam"
* [House Mesr](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/House_Mesr) - "Eel"
* [House Bast](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/House_Bast) - "Shark"
* [House Noi](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/House_Noi) - "Fish"
* [House Sabes](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/House_Sabes) - "Crab"
* [House Rak](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/House_Rak) - "Sea Scorpion"
* [House Kol](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/House_Kol) - "Fern"
* [House Hail](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/House_Hail) - "Mushroom"
* [House Jeuk](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/House_Jeuk) - "Squid"
* [House Ai](/content/kyahida_wiki/wiki/House_Ai) - "Zero": The automatic Nanike of exiled, shunned, orphaned, and feral Sakire

There are many more Nanike, but most of them are subordinate, hybrid Nanike that will align with one of the Nanike above. Others are unorthodox or illegitimate houses that do not get moot representation or are informal. Very commonly there are internal classes within Nanike whose memberships are temporary, typically used for punishment or quarantine when actual exile to Ai is considered too harsh. Sakire considered cursed (multiple miscarriages, diseased, unlucky, and deformed, amongst other reasons) by the Nanike's Totem aren't typically exiled but placed into one of these "half-Ai" Nanike until the curse is considered passed or repaid.

There is a dazzling number of Hybrid Nanike caused by inter-Nanike marriage, but these will declare a primary Nanike to align with. Urban Kandre do this more often than nomadic Kandre, who tend to adopt the spouse. These hybrids are more about Kandre identity than political/religious affiliations, and are more popular in urban areas because Lekul membership tends to be a bit more important in day-to-day affairs there in the highly-mixed environment.
