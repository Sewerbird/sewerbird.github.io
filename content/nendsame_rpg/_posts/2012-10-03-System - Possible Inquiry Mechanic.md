title: System - Possible Inquiry Mechanic
---

I've been thinking a lot about how to make my roleplaying game amenable to solitaire play: I want it to be easy to sit down with pen &amp; paper on a boring afternoon, quickly toss together a character, and wander around Jezevel for a while. The previous playtest post was a transcript of me trying how to hash the process out: I didn't know what'd happen next, although I set the initial scene and general objective before hand. I then proceeded by asking questions that popped into my head about the environment, which one would normally direct to a game master... but I had none, and didn't want to really be one myself (I wanted to feel like a player, not a DM). So I stole a neat mechanic I've seen before, "Inquiry Dice".

An Inquiry dice is a solution to the question "Well, how true is Proposition A?": you roll a six-sided dice with sides mapping to "Yes", "Yes, and...", "Yes, but..." and their negative equivalents. You ask the question, the roll gives you the gist of the answer, and you elaborate on the consequences. For example, if I am confronted with a waterway in my travels, I can ask "Is the water safe to swim in?". I then roll the Inquiry dice, and might get a "Yes, but" result: this means that I can swim in the waterway, *BUT* there might be something to be wary of: this dice result could mean "Yes, but you can't stay in its icy waters for very long" or "Yes, but you aren't sure that there aren't dangerous fish in it" or so on.

"But" means the answer has a caveat that lessens its potency, while "And" means the answer is even more true than anticipated. If I ask "Is it raining outside?", a "No, And" could mean "No, it's not raining and is indeed quite hot out". "No, but" could mean that there wasn't any precipitation, but there are still puddles around. Pretty straightforward really.

So, when you don't really know what should happen next in the course of play, kick out a question and brainstorm on its result: that's how I did my short 15-min playtest, and it came out alright I think (it'd've gone quicker, but I was typing it all up). The important thing to remember is to keep the scope of the question pretty straightforward: keep it simple!

In my playtest, I made each roll of the Inquiry dice cost one of the two actions you get each turn: I figured this'd keep me from cheesing the freedom of the dice too much. I think it might end up being kind of interesting to keep the Inquire action as an in-game action, and I'll have to see if it would survive in multi-player, no DM play.
