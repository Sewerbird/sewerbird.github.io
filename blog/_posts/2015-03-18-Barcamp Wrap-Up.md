This past Saturday (March 14th) I had the pleasure of attending and presenting at Barcamp 2015 at the NYU campus in Shanghai!

##What is Barcamp?

Barcamp is billed as an 'un-conference', and I don't really quite know what that means. My understanding is that the conference format is in opposition to corporate technical conferences that have a preset schedule full of presenters pitching their own stuff. As such, Barcamp is characterized by a few main traits:

- Anyone who attends may present
- Rooms' timeslots are made available on a whiteboard in the main lobby area
- To reserve a timeslot, one simply writes their name and presentation title on the whiteboard
- Presentations may not be used to advertise or pitch your own professional work
- Any kind of presentation (technical, non-technical, silly) is allowed, as long as it is interesting

As such, I give a presentation at every Barcamp on something a bit light-hearted: this year I talked about paper airplanes.

##My Talk

I gave a presentation to what ended up being about 150 people, by my estimate. I gave a brief introduction to the primary forces on a glider plane (drag, lift, and gravity) and the objectives of the folds in a paper airplane. I also went over the various kinds of paper airplanes and the real-life vessels they share kinship with.

All that took about 5 minutes, and I moved on to showing people how to fold the dart-like in my presentation, The Squid. I showed my hands on the projector using my MacBook camera, and it was gratifying to see a hundred people follow me step by step. I think I ought to reconsider being a professor - teaching class is fun!

When we had all folded the plane, I prompted them to throw their planes out of their seats and hit me, and the rest of the half hour was spent tossing their planes back to them and plenty of paper flights. My friend Robin took video which I hope to make available here at a later point!
