One interesting thing about China is that, when a shop goes out of business, it is stripped down to drywall within 24 hours of its last business. What this means is that, having gone there the day before and had a dinner, I'll go "oh nice, I'll go again today" and find it to be cordoned off and the inside bare concrete. It's really startling when it happens, and it seems to happen regularly!
