<div>I am now the proud owner of a 130cc motorbike.</div><div><br /></div><div>It has a top speed (artificial engine pin limit) of 70kmh, and is black with red stripes (pictures forthcoming). It has a small gas tank, and it looks like it's 90km/City, 120/Country. It rides just like a bicycle, except goes about 10 times as fast. I've ridden 100km on it around the maze of streets this weekend, and am hoping to get my plates in a week maybe, and maybe a helmet. This is certainly a lot different learning-to-drive experience than highway driving in a sedan! I've only had one "Eek!" moment so far (a mean chinese guy tried to run me off the road), but even that I handled with (I think) excellent reaction time. I sincerely believe that if I can learn to drive in Shanghai, I can drive anywhere.</div><div><br /></div><div>It's registered under my chinese name <i>Ai De Hua</i>, which apparantly means 'the love of words' and sounds vaguely like 'Edward'.</div><div><br /></div><div>And yes, I'll be very very careful ;-)</div>
