Hey there!<br /><br />I've resigned from my job, and will finish my work at the company at the end of the month. Still deciding if I'll have a vacation with friends here in Shanghai for a month thereafter, or go straight back home on the first. I resigned largely over an honest evaluation of my relationship with the company, the fact that I am financially secure for the next year, and a desire to start a new chapter for myself personally.<br /><br />What an exciting day!
