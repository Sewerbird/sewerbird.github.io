Been hectic, but some fun stuff has happened.<br /><br />I'm running a Dungeons & Dragon game (4th edition), with all my western coworkers as players. I'm running a Dark Suns game, which will mean a lot of blighted desert and insect monsters. My coworkers' party consists of an elven Raider, a psionic Templar judge, and a sanctioned Defiler mage. <br /><br />Although the game features the dominance of the Sorceror Kings over their city in the campaign book, I'm fast-forwarding to the future where the intrusion of The Gray (a scary nether-dimension) has resulted in an even more chaotic than normal setting where all the Sorceror Kings have either died or gone missing. <br /><br />The party is a troupe of templars who are in the service of the Sorceror King of Balic, a city on a peninsula into a quicksand sea. They are returning across the Great Ivory Plain from Gulg after a failed diplomatic effort: Gulg is in chaos, with its Sorceror Queen dead, nullifying their mission. Concerned that their own Sorceror King is gone too, they trek south across the great salt flat.<br /><br />First for-real adventure is tonight!
