Work is coming along well, although my tasks have petered out creativity-wise: it's mostly just coordinating people and tweaking large lists, since it's mostly up to programmers and artists now. I find summer in China to be oppressively humid and hot, so I have to admit I've been loathe to do anything other than hit work and hide in my room. =)
