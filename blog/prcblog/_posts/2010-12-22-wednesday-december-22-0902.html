Last night, I went to a place across the street and ordered braised dog. <br /><br />It was really tasty! It had the texture of steak, although the flavor was much more like lamb. In the spicy hot pot, I dare say it has been one of the better meat dishes I've had in China. We ordered it along with lamb, and we had difficulty telling which was which: we identified the dog by virtue of the hip-joint piece. The kind of dog used to eat is usually some kind of small yip-dog: likely a pomeranian.<br /><br />I wonder if there is dog bacon: then I could have some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug_iluxQ1IQ&feature=related">Beggin' Strips</a>. It's BACON!
