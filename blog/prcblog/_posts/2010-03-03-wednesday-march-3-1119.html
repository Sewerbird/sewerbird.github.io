Back to work today: went home early on Monday and slept through Tuesday: feeling better now though, and payday is in a week! I'm managing to stow away some RMB, so that I can have some nice money when I get back: it'll be a modest amount, but should pay my expenses for several months, and what more could you ask of your cash than that? =)
