Hope all is going well for you all!<br /><br />Today I make a presentation for the company that will decide exactly how much money the project will continue to be given, and ultimately how much revenue share I and the rest of the development team get of the final. I'm a bit anxious, but it should go alright.<br /><br />Only, like, 3 weeks until I fly back!
