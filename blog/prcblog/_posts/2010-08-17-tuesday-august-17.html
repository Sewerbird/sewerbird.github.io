Urghk... my visa is about to expire and apparantly I have to fly to Hong Kong and stay overnight Thursday-Friday while they handle it. I just hope I'm back in time to see Chris off to Britain, and I'm really not very enthusiastic about this abrupt itinerary, and vaguely pessimisstic about being able to figure out what I'm supposed to do alone in Hong Kong dealing with a pseudo-Chinese bureaucracy of Doom.
