Just because, the names of everyone who has posted on this blog in my made-up language (sorry if I missed someone! it won't let me search through comments):<br /><br />Take your name from this list...<br /><br />Edward  : Guardian  = Saribke "suh-RIHV-kuh"<br />Kirk    : Church    = Sidhe "SEE-theh"<br />Tamara  : Palm Tree = Nesuldha "neh-SULTH-uh"<br />Barbara : Stranger  = Risdha "RIZ-thuh"<br />George  : Farmer    = Suasre "SWAHZ-ruh"<br />Rachel  : Lamb      = Kerenme "ke-REN-muh"<br />Ronald  : Advisor   = Diceke "di-JEHK-uh"<br />Michael : Who's like god? = Israel "is-RA-ehl"  (funny coincidence, that name!)<br /><br />And then put your last name after it...<br /><br />Miller: "In misty lands" = ne Seraba      "neh  seh-RAV-ah"<br />Marler: "In wild lands" = ne Relaba       "neh  reh-LAV-ah"<br />Davis: "In sunny lands" = ne Kaliba       "neh  kah-LIV-ah"<br /><br />(These are the place-locations I associate with the lastnames: mom's side is generally in the West out in the country, dad's side I associate with the Pacific Northwest, and Rachel is from California.)<br /><br />So I'd be<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Saribke ne Seraba</span>
