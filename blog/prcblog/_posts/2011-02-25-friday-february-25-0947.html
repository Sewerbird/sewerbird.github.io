1/11/10 - 2/25/11, Game Design Lead<br /><br />I've worked in China for over a year now: kind of hard to believe in a way. Today is my last day at work, and I look around me to see very few familiar places: the company has almost completely turned over, staff wise, during my stay. Only four people remain, and we can't really talk to each other.<br /><br />My favorite memories are:<br />-Riding to the Sea with Chris<br />-Chinese New Year's with Sean/Chris<br />-Scooter riding with the guys<br />-Counter-Strike\Starcraft\Ping-Pong with the guys<br />-Hitting on girls at DADA<br />-Goth Night<br />-Rock Band with Michal<br />-Being big-guy, design-wise<br />-Hong Kong<br />-Trying to keep up with Blake's walking pace when I was getting first situated<br /><br />My bitterest memories are:<br />-The SoZ meltdown<br />-All the artists quitting<br />-Having my scooter stolen<br />-The situations associated with Sean/Chris/Jeff/Blake leaving<br /><br />Hopefully, my 'vacation month' here will be filled of many more positive memories. I am heading to Hong Kong to get a Tourist Visa, then will stay in Shanghai until the end of March, where I will then be hanging out in Seattle for a month or two. By that time, I will have spent 1 year and 50 days cumulative time within China's borders.<br /><br />Great Adventure indeed!
