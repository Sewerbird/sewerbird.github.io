Our Heroes do something imaginative and new: they attack a dungeon of Evil!<br /><br /><b>Encounter 13: I Really Really Really Hate Wights</b><br /><br />Saribke and Mia stroll into the tombs, only to be beset by a trio of skeleton archers and two wights. The battle is very short, but the wights manage to steal 4 healing surges from Mia before being slain, and Saribke only manages to kill the archers in time to save Mia from dying. Mia heals up and uses up all her remaining healing. Great...<br /><br />Result: Easy win, but Mia got unlucky and targetted. She has to go the rest of the encounter with no healing whatsoever...<br /><br /><b>Encounter 14: Zombies Hit Haaaaard</b><br /><br />Saribke leads ahead of Mia by 30 feet and runs into a set of zombies and blazing skeleton archers. Tanking all the damage, Saribke gets pummelled by the zombie slams, and Our Heroes destroy the enemy only after much chicanery with kiting tactics.<br /><br />Result: Punishing, but a victory. Hiding Mia from fire was hard, and Saribke really took a beating from several lucky zombie hits. So far, the encounter is going very quickly but very difficultly.<br /><br /><b>Encounter 15: Obligatory Necromancer</b><br /><br />In the deepest part of the tomb, Our Heroes find a hulking zombie commanded by an evil necromancer. Saribke and Mia quickly kill the zombie, but it rises again thanks to the necromancer. Going to Plan B, Saribke and Mia run all around the room harassing the necromancer, but the zombie manages to corner Mia and kill her outright: not unconscious, but cold dead. Enraged, Saribke does some exceptional positioning and usage of techniques to kill the necromancer, and shortly overcomes the hulking zombie. After snatching 1000gp from the necromancer and a pair of Rings of Brotherhood (a healing item), Saribke carries Mia out of the tomb, and pays for a Raise Dead ritual to be performed on her.<br /><br />Result: Saribke and Mia use all their action points to good effect, but Mia is simply too hurt from having no healing this Delve to survive a strong attack from the zombie hulk. The necromancer was annoying and almost ended the party. This delve only barely paid for itself, and the only good thing that happened was that the duo levelled up. My least favorite delve so far: healing surge removal is a death sentence for my team!
