Testing out highlighting on my assault marines... being super cautious, since I have some model-fear. Mixed Gray & Black 1:1 and got a very subtle shine on the model's exposed surfaces, leaving crannies black. Any tips on highlighting? Right now just planning on going 1:1 to 2:1 to 3:1 with more limited application each go, then applying a black wash, then a gray re-highlight.
