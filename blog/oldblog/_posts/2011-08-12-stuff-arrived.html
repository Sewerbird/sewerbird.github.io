My GW order arrived today:<br /><br />-2 Assault Squad boxes<br />-Codex: SM book<br />-2 brushes<br />-6 paints<br /><br />Still waiting on my Forge World sprues, which should arrive either tomorrow or early next week.<br />-2 Raven Guard upgrade sprues<br />-1 Captain Korvydae<br /><br />Idea is to make a very special assault squad to accompany Korvydae: his rules (if my opponent allows Forge World rules) lets me take assault squads as Troops units as long as I bring along a scout unit too... in all other senses he is just a jumppack Captain. The big thing there is that it'll let my assault squads not only contest objectives, but claim them too!<br /><br />I'm hashing out a tentative Army List plan tonight: goal is to have a very mobile, fluffy force emphasizing mobility and precision deep striking that can play well from 500 to 2000 points.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Forge World sprues arrived too... the detail is incredible on them!<br /><br />Also grabbed cutters and a file from the hardware store... will be fun to get started in on these models!
