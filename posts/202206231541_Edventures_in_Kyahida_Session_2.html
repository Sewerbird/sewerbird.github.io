    <h1> Edventures in Kyahida Session 2</h1>
  
  <p>These are my public notes for the events of the second session. They are provided to record what happened for posterity, and for reference of the players.</p>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>The party interviewed Carp, Hispeth, Viola, and Stone. Striking Panther came to blows with Margareta. The party investigated the Chieftain&#39;s skeleton and the site of his murder. It would seem someone in the tribe murdered him, not a wilder as the Council hopes.</p>

<h2>Session 2: Investigating the Death of Chief Winter</h2>

<p>Yunni and Pacha started the morning by visiting the home of Carp. Briefly meeting his three wives and many children, Carp offered his assistance. Yunni revealed her suspicions of his intent, and challenged him on the merit of his claim to the chieftaincy. Carp responded benevolently, and disinvited the two after a bit of rude conversation.</p>

<p>The rest of the party sought out Stone to inquire after the fungal boar that he had mentioned the prior day. Stone told them that the only allowed hunting right now was in the camp&#39;s stream, since the orcas on the sea and the boar in the forest were too dangerous. He directed them to visit Hispeth for details on the boar. He also didn&#39;t think the wasting sickness was fungal, since it is usually obvious when a Kyahidan is being affected by it.</p>

<p>Striking Panther and Sven then went to talk to Ted the Longman, and ask about how he died, since he was the first person claimed by the wasting sickness. He revealed that he had fought a golem and been burned by a laser to his shoulder, survived, but then succumbed to the wasting some months later. His shoulder was buried out at the Lover&#39;s Lane north of town, since it was deemed dangerous to be used at his funerary feast. Later in the day, Striking Panther found the hillock where it was buried and found the weed that had metabolized the meat to grow.</p>

<p>The whole Erikander then rendezvous&#39;d with Hispeth at the main longhouse, and finally got to talk to her alone. Hispeth revealed that the brain stew from last night was made with boar brain, since the brain of the Chief was not available: he had been beheaded when his body was found! The Council had sworn the hunter Finger to silence while figuring out how to handle the devastating news, suspecting Wilder foul play. However, Hispeth fears that the murderer is a kinsman, painful as it is for her to conceive. Hispeth also verified that the funerary feast preparations are very thorough and up to standard.</p>

<p>Next, the party went to Viola&#39;s hut on the edge of town, where Striking Panther had a hostile encounter with Margareta when she insulted Wilders and Sansibi too much for his tastes. The Erikander interviewed Viola, who corroborated much of what Hispeth had said, and then offered them access to the Chieftain&#39;s body in the shed, halfway through the Bonesinging process. The party found a fresh blade nick on his ribcage and noticed his expensive bronze blade was missing from his belongings.</p>

<p>Striking Panther got into a fistfight with Margareta after attempting to intimidate her, and nearly was arrested by Viola and the Council. Carp brokered a calm and defused the situation. The Erikander was brought some lunch and they travelled a short ways north across the creek to go to the Chieftain&#39;s murder scene.</p>

<p>Striking Panther and Yunni traded stories along the way, and Kosumi tracked moccassined footsteps heading off the trail. His keen eye spotted a speck of brain on a rock, and nearby signs of a struggle was found. It would appear that two individuals in shows scuffled, and one had their head caved in on a rock on the ground, and then beheaded. It would seem a high-class Bluecane had committed the murder and secreted away the head. But who?</p>
